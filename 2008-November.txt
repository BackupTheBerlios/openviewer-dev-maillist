Subject: [Openviewer-dev] BVH format
Message-ID: <f1042c500811081638y500d14a8sb7951f04ca148b59@mail.gmail.com>

so here's what I've learned:

the Euler angles are in the local coord space for each rotation.  In other
words, assuming ZXY ordering, first you rotate the space about the Z axis;
then you rotate about the NEW, post-Z rotation X axis; then about the new Y
axis.

Then, in this new coordinate system, you offset to the next node (joint or
end site).  If it's a joint, you repeat the process starting in these new
coords.

what does offset mean exactly?  The skeleton is specified already; offset is
an artifact of BVH's original use as a motion capture format.  Offset should
take you to the location of the next joint; the place where bones are
connected.  If a BVH offset doesn't match the skeleton exactly, I assume the
animation will look a bit different.  I have no idea if SL cares about
offset; my guess is no.

Hi,

while being the last person to give advice on how to write fast code (rather on how to write code fast ? as in dirty), I stumbled across this page:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Blending_Into_Python/Optimize
(and the link therein: http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips )

What struck me was that the 'try' statement is 10 times slower in general as the 'if' statement (which I didn?t know ) and this page above gives the hint that one should avoid using 'try' in main loops. 

I did only a quick check, and found only a few of them. Might be worth checking on these, though.

Best regards,
  Dirk
