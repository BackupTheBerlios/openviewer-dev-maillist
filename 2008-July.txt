My take on the UI is that everyone is going to want something slightly
different here, so our best bet is to provide a kind of
middle-of-the-road UI that is easily extensible and modifiable.

I'd also suggest that we avoid adding any UI components until the
underlying functionality exists.  It's all too easy to get sucked into
designing a beautiful UI, but one where all the buttons are greyed
out.

+1 to chi11ken's statement.  I think there will be too many heated
opinions on what the UI design should be.  It also takes attention
away from what is really needed right now, functionality.

The great thing about OpenViewer is that it is easy for someone to
create a fully custom viewer that fits their needs.

Thats why I was doing the .glade UI base I did as only being base
material... I was hopefully aiming for not being "feature complete"
but instead
  have a mechanism where plugins can "add" or "replace" existing
functionality as the user chooses

The only issue would then come down to plugin availability,  which is
why I had the mozilla plugins repo in mind myself for such things...
  providing a central directory of plugins to the viewer all clearly
marked as written by whomever writes the specific plugin...

I know it was not all that clear for the .glade file I posted up...
but I was offering it up more for commentary to hash out something
respectable
  as a UI "base"... so that there isnt just a single person pushing a
UI on everyone but getting a more "rounded" UI experience together
  and also discussing places where the UI needs to remain "incomplete"
to push people into designing and implimenting plugins to fill gaps

as for functionality... Im still trying to track down what happens to
the image data for it to *be* cachable like the rest of the asset
content,
  I am definitively missing something... and Im not totally sure what
I am missing in my trying various things

Hi everyone,

I'm interested in doing some openviewer development, and I had a few questions about its status.

Is openviewer under active development? I've been following the IRC channels and the mailing lists for about a little while and there seems to be very little activity. The roadmap/milestones on the website seem to be ambiguous about anticipated completion dates.

In the Media portion of Openviewer, there's a few screenshots of Openviewer running the Mogre wrapper - however, there's no Mogre code in SVN. Are there plans to transition OpenViewer to use Mogre instead of OgreDotNet? I believe OgreDotNet is no longer being updated.

In my development environment (VS2008/XP), I ran into a couple of multi-threading issues. I've got a couple of work-arounds - is anyone interested in this code?

Yes.  There hasn't been much activity on the mailing list or IRC
lately because we've been a little side-tracked looking into some new
possibilities.

We were using Mogre, but it's a Windows-only library.  We've updated
the old OgreDotNet to work with recent versions of Ogre, and now it's
working on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.  As of r324, we've switched
to only officially supporting OgreDotNet.

Is this under WinForms?  I'm not sure we'll use WinForms long-term due
to the somewhat lacking support under mono, but there may be people
interested in using it for particular projects.  If you have any code
to contribute, it would be much appreciated.  You can submit patches
through trac on the OpenViewer website.

Hi Jeff,

Thanks for your reply!

What other things are you looking into? I'm trying to get a sense for where this project is headed.

Can you tell me what the goal of openviewer is? What will it provide that the opensource secondlife client won't? What timeline do you see for when openviewer development? How much of the existing codebase do you see being rewritten in the near future?

That makes a lot of sense. Is performance an important consideration for openviewer? As I understand it, the SWIG wrappers that ogredotnet uses have a penalty due to lots of boxing/unboxing. (Although I'm no expert, this might not be significant at all)

One of the bugs was with winforms. The other was an object sharing issue between the World and the TerrainManager. I've submitted the patch through trac.
