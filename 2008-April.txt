This is hopefully fixed in r261.  Could someone test this on Windows
and see if it works?

Message-ID: <351467290804072027p640420d6tbbe543099e71b92f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

This mailing list thread is to start discussion on server migration.
We have two problems that are a hindrance to the progression of
OpenViewer, and I speak of them with great humbleness and respect to
the people who have been working on OpenViewer:

- There are not enough active people to sustain patch inclusion, checking, etc.
- We cannot easily grow the active people who are committers because
of our connection to opensim (many of our contributors happen to be
coders of both projects)

The plan D-Font and myself are going to pursue is for the betterment
of our group.  We believe that a transition to a new source code
repository location is the answer.  We have formed a group on Google
code, which provides free SVN access to groups.  There are benefits
and cons to this solution which we will pursue:

Benefits:
- Non-connection with OpenSim, allowing both projects to add new
members without risk of trashing the others code
- Free hosting for SVN
- Little maintenance for running source code repository
- Many users have gmail accounts or can easily obtain them for use if
they become members
- free source code browsing and search
Cons:
- Only gmail accounts may be used
- Does not provide offerings of git for developers interested ( we may
have to set this up elsewhere )

Please note that this change in source repository will not change the
policy of our group on adding new members to get commit access (in the
OpenSim tradition).  Additionally, all old members with commit access
will get access as members of the Google code group.  Myself, Daedius,
and D-Font will be administering this google code project and thusly
have code access as well unless there is some great outcry against us.

We will be making the transition after some discussion of SVN
structure layout, and then update the wiki accordingly.  If you have
any ideas, objections, praises on this topic, please feel free to post
them below! This transition will be made on Wednesday, April 9th,
unless we have great objection in the following discussion.  If you
are an existing committer, please send either D-Font or myself your
gmail contact information and you will be added promptly.  Lastly, if
it is not blatantly clear, this is not an effort to fork openviewer.
Our unity is one of our greatest strengths.  Thanks and happy coding!

- Daedius

For my own 2-cents, I can say that I feel that every new project lives and dies by its active developers, and that if OpenViewer wants to live, it needs to be more open to accepting more contributors.

Yes we all agreed that openviewer needs to move to a new server and have more commiters and we were actively working towards moving it to a new server. 

However I'm afraid when a group of people just take it on themselves to move it and set themselves up as the admins of the new project then thats really a fork and thats how I at this time feel about this.

Just to explain what my biggest problem with this is. 
 It relates to one of your sentences: 

"Please note that this change in source repository will not change the
policy of our group on adding new members to get commit access (in the
OpenSim tradition)."

Basically in my view, this has been broke at least four times in what has happened here.
We have that policy on Core members voting for new memember and any other big decision.

Two in yourself and D-front becoming core members without that vote. Another one in you both being the admins without a vote.
And in the project being moved to google without a vote. Now its very possible that all of these things would have got a go ahead after a vote. 
But those votes weren't held so it broke that policy and hurt trust. 

So I have to consider this google project a fork. That should change its name to something other than openviewer.

Hello,

I'm sure this is done with the best of intentions.  However, splitting
off from the core team, starting your own repository, adding
committers, and then emailing the list announcing it and telling the
core developers that they should express their opinions on the matter
by tomorrow, or else it goes through, is not likely to be received well.

As MW pointed out, this already breaks the policy of adding new
members to the group.  Following this example, anyone who wants access
in the future could just clone the repository, add themselves and
whoever else they want, and declare that the new official home of
OpenViewer.  In essence, you *are* forking the code.

> There are not enough active people to sustain patch inclusion,
> checking, etc.

I see two open patches in mantis, both of which have been reviewed and
are waiting on some kind of issue.  I don't see any that are waiting
on a core developer.

Of course, having more active developers is helpful, and I don't think
anyone on this project is averse to accepting more contributors
(though of course I speak only for myself).

Until the logistic issues are resolved, though, I'd recommend we simply
continue with the existing methods of tracking and applying patches.

Jeff

Perhaps I am not clear enough in my original email.  This is not a
fork.  If you all could please be on topic, that would be appreciated.
 It would be nice to have a formality of people doing what they say
they intend to do about adding new devs in the OpenSim spirit, but
I've not seen that happen or any discussion of it to happen, and the
way our source code is a limitation to everything related to that.
There are active people who want to do things, and just because a few
people have commit access to one repository doesn't entirely mean the
wheels of progress will stop.

MW, i'm not sure how a google account rules out Google code hosting.
I've made two new accounts just in joining this group for wiki and
berlios.  If creating a new account is going to be keeping a new dev
from working on the project, that sounds like a problem with the dev
more than our system.  Technically, do you have anything against
google code?

Chi11ken, we thank you for your help.  But honostly, you must realize
how we've lost faith in the current arrangement a bit.  Additionally,
this last week we have been focused on getting 3d from ogredotnet to
work on our respective machines, play around with ogre3d, think about
3d could be done, and write tests for your ogredotnet.  That is
probably why you don't see any patches.  Also, you talk about waiting
until the "logistics issues are resolved", well, this is the
discussion thread to talk about them. Please do.

Lastly, if you all don't believe I wouldn't hand over the reigns of
administration openviewer on Google code you are mistaken.  Please
work with me and see my intention are for the best of the group and
keeping us together.  I know this topic is rough, but I have talked
about it to the active members in IRC for the last week among our
other tasks, hoping that you would have followed up on progressing
this issue ( but have not ).  I am trying to be as humble as possible
and I hope you see that I enjoy working with you all.

Sorry, I forgot to mention in my last email that we will put this
transition on hold for now.  The warning bell that this needs to be
discussed more have obviously been set off, and I am prepared for
that.  I honestly did not know how you all would respond.

Thanks

Hello,

I'm sure this is done with the best of intentions.  However, splitting
off from the core team, starting your own repository, adding
committers, and then emailing the list announcing it and telling the
core developers that they should express their opinions on the matter
by tomorrow, or else it goes through, is not likely to be received well.

As MW pointed out, this already breaks the policy of adding new
members to the group.  Following this example, anyone who wants access
in the future could just clone the repository, add themselves and
whoever else they want, and declare that the new official home of
OpenViewer.  In essence, you *are* forking the code.

I see two open patches in mantis, both of which have been reviewed and
are waiting on some kind of issue.  I don't see any that are waiting
on a core developer.

Of course, having more active developers is helpful, and I don't think
anyone on this project is averse to accepting more contributors
(though of course I speak only for myself).

Until the logistic issues are resolved, though, I'd recommend we simply
continue with the existing methods of tracking and applying patches.

Jeff

Hey there Charles

Thanks for chiming in. Do you have any options to present to address
our problems?  Or does you vote of no imply that your comfortable with
adding new people to the current shared opensim/openviewer repo?  I'm
trying to understand your short response.

In my opinion, it is important to support the opinions of Mw. This whole thing is his vision.

Things never move fast enough when one is waiting on someone else to do something, and I feel that also. But working together long-term is the most important part. 

This whole thing is a marathon. We are just embarking on the OpenViewer marathon and it will take longer then we can imagine to finish it.

The strategy for commit is:

1. Submit a few patches and work with the core developers to get them committed, thus establishing a relationship.

2. From time to time, the core developers will vote and invite a new member to the team from those who submit patches.

The reason for this is to allow all the participants to ensure they can work together with each other long-term.

I completely agree with MW on this one.  I know some of the patches
going in are a little slow, but we want to take the time to really
review everything to make sure that everything is of top quality.  We
are at the very early stages of development in this project, and it's
building up the core of OpenViewer.  If we rush things in, then we
will end up doing countless rewrites.   I would like to avoid that as
much as possible.

As MW said, we were actively working on moving the SVN to it's own set
of servers, and expanding commit access to some that have shown good
quality patches.  I will continue to support this specific project,
and not the google code project, and I hope everyone else can agree
with that as well.

 I did want to chime in as well. I want to say that this is not about
control, commit access or patches, it is very much about progress and
communication. If progress can happen with the current system, I fully
support that. If moving to a new server will create progress I'll support
that. My biggest concern is stagnation of the project.  Right now I believe
that there are people that have a very clear idea of where they want
OpenViewer to go. My concern is that I've only heard this from a few people.
I feel like there are quite a few people that are passionate about
OpenViewer yet I don't have great clarity on what is to be done other than
getting it "done". I would like all of us that care about the project to be
on the same page. How can we do that?

I also want to acknowledge that I have not read the proper processes for
change. Where can I find these?

I think you brought up a very important issue, and thats only a few people are trying to decide where openviewer should go, and too much of that talk is happening on irc, as has been the problem a lot of us haven't had time to be on irc a lot lately. So if more of all this talking happened on this mailing list, it would give everyone a chance to be involved. 

Daedius said in one of his emails, how they had been talking about how things should work, well most of that should be on the mailing list. or at least a summary of what was talked about. 

As for we all being on the same page, in some sense that isn't going to happen completely as we all have different ideas. I think some even have a completely different vision of what the project is about to others. But as long as there is enough in common then we can still work together.

Just what happened was not the way to go about things.

I want to say that this is not about control, commit access or patches, it is very much about progress and communication. If progress can happen with the current system, I fully support that. If moving to a new server will create progress I'll support that. My biggest concern is stagnation of the project.  Right now I believe that there are people that have a very clear idea of where they want OpenViewer to go. My concern is that I've only heard this from a few people. I feel like there are quite a few people that are passionate about OpenViewer yet I don't have great clarity on what is to be done other than  getting it "done". I would like all of us that care about the project to be on the same page. How can we do that?
 
I also want to acknowledge that I have not read the proper processes for change. Where can I find these?

 I completely agree with MW on this one.  I know some of the patches
 going in are a little slow, but we want to take the time to really
 review everything to make sure that everything is of top quality.  We
 are at the very early stages of development in this project, and it's
 building up the core of OpenViewer.  If we rush things in, then we
 will end up doing countless rewrites.   I would like to avoid that as
 much as possible.
 
 As MW said, we were actively working on moving the SVN to it's own set
 of servers, and expanding commit access to some that have shown good
 quality patches.  I will continue to support this specific project,
 and not the google code project, and I hope everyone else can agree
 with that as well.

Hello, in the irc channel the idea of Test Driven Development was brought
up. The idea being that this will assist in making sure the code quality is
there. It was also mentioned that if the whole group is not on board with
this idea it will not float. What do people think about this?

+1 For test driven development.

Our group is small, and we have the opportunity to influence the
methodology of how OpenViewer will be created for years to come.  We
should aim for a process that tries to keep a real view of the quality
of our application.  I feel test driven development is that way.
Break down our application into small testable chunks of code.

I think this is good in many ways.  For example, just yesterday,
Harrison was having a trouble testing OgreDotNet in isolation.  We did
not know what his issue was exactly,  So I created an nunit test so he
can run a ogredotnet 3d window alone without any other dependencies.
With such tests our our library, we can give people a suite of tests
that people can run on their respective operating system and runtime
to verify our code works under our assumptions, or to aid them in
resolving issues when they do not function.

Hey everyone, I wanted to send out an email to gather some ideas we
can put on a new server of our own, get opinions about what people are
looking for, here are some of my ideas:

- Wordpress developer blog
- Mindtouch wiki ( has better support for videos, comments, mashups )
- Mind map would be cool, I know there is some cool wiki versions of
this out there
- SVN obviously
- SVN browser, that way we can show each other peice of code easily
- An account and space we could do some automated builds on

I have worked quite a lot with Test Driven Development.
 
+1 on doing it now, if it's ever going to be done; retrofitting code for TDD is notoriously hairy.
 
* Make sure everbody sees the difference between unit testing and integration testing (and that they should be separate test spaces)
* Badly written tests are as hampering for development as badly written code. Make sure your test test exactly the requisite it's supposed to; not more, not less. Refactor code to accomodate for testing.
* Tests should live in assemblies side by side with the code it's testing, following the same code and name conventions.
 
One of the effects of TDD is 'decoupling', since you want to be able to test isolated units.
Also, you really don't want your call stack to get deep (since that's complicating the scenario setup) so code for simple operations involving few actors.
Also, TDD tends to push the developer away from state; it's difficult to write tests to proof changes in the internal state of an object. Incidentally, this leads to better code, as many bugs and unnessecary complexities emanate from use of state.

(Some opinions and not necessarily in the order presented)

First, wrt "User should be able to type in action text": 
The client should change "/me" to the speaking user's name.  The user shouldnt 
have to type in action text, the client should just handle it.  

Second, wrt the about screens: 
Can we load that text from a file instead of embedding it inside the glade 
files?

"Enter in a URL for us to try to extrapolate a grid for them to connect to":
So then it would basically brute-force a loginuri? Like, if a user entered 
"osgrid.org", would it just try logging in using "http://www.osgrid.org:8002"?

The address bar controls are rather unintuitive.  Those buttons should 
probably go into menu options instead, and be replaced with a "Go!" button on 
the right side of the address bar.  If I want my browsing history, I'll go 
to "History", if I want my favorites, I'll go to "Favorites" just like every 
other browser since NCSA Mosaic.  Also, connect/disconnect is rather weighty 
to put on the address bar, since personally it takes about 20 seconds to log 
in to any grid.  It's comparable to re-dialing on a dialup modem, and I dont 
need to accidentally click that while I'm browsing.  If I want to connect, 
I'll type it in or select it from a list and hit enter or click the "go" 
button.  If I want to disconnect, I'll close the tab (or the whole client), 
or if it's there and I really want to, a "logout" selection from a mennu 
somewhere.

Also, in the "Accounts" dialog, instead of "Add" perhaps consider naming that 
button "New".

I think OS has just committed a patch from lulurun to allow logins from
URLs of the form http://grid.org/region/x/y/z

Hey there everyone,

I first want to say thank you for all the feedback I've received from
you all =)  I am sending out revision 2 for you all to look at.
There's been some significant changes since rev 1, particularly with
avatar management, address bar, and some other new slides.

http://developer.berlios.de/mantis/file_download.php?file_id=23&type=bug

Please send me your criticism, praise, etc.  Keep in mind, that the
more we get this right now, the less we recode later. =) Thanks.

Message-ID: <f38794ad0804120856q3067d252l5d0d753d0e8f6db@mail.gmail.com>

I was just taking a little look at the plugin manager classes and the
ModuleLoader class and I was wondering if there is a specific reason why all
plugins are loaded and instantiated then searched in memory rather than
loading only the requested plugin? I'm wondering if down the line loading
everything that is available wouldn't cause a lot of bloat for things that
aren't being used.

This is an outrage. We can't develop by mailing patches around. Why have a
repository at all in that case?

I like it as a good first step.

If there is no criticisms, then I think we can move forward with this. Speak
now or forever hold your piece. ;)

Thanks for checking it over sempuki =)  I agree, this first part of
the week I am going to form an architecture plan for this guy.  By
mid-week I should be stubbing it all out, and then coding.  If anyone
has experience in architecture and design patterns.  Please join the
conversation when I start posting! =)  I hope to be able to give a
clear vision to all those who want to program on the GtkUI what needs
to be done, and how to keep all our code in line with the same system
when we do it.

Hey everyone,

Ckrinke and I noticed the windows plugins of openviewers weren't
working: here's how you can fix them

- check out the latest version of libsecond life ( 1751 for me ),
compile, and copy the libsecondlife and openjpeg dlls into
openviewer/bin
- then apply this patch below

Login() seems to be broken with the latest builds of libsecondlife (
Though maybe I am seeing glitches with OSGrid), so I've started using
BeginLogin(), which we probably should be doing anyways

I would like to suggest that for OpenViewer we should concentrate on getting a well defined setup on our computers, be they Windows or Linux. Then next a well defined recipe for compiling with no errors and minimal warnings. Then third a well defined test on a common region or regions that allows anyone to test OpenViewer.

I would suggest that the first one be defined on our wiki so we can say:

"See wiki page X for the setup required for your computer to compile successfully OpenViewer".

Then the second one be defined so we can say:

"See wiki page Y and checkout our svn, runprebuild.bat, build, run and it should run with no errors"

The the third one be defined so we can say:

"Logon to standaloneA or GridG to the region framelwanker and you should see terrain, prims, walk, chat and logoff with no errors"

as far as I'm aware, the setup page on the wiki for windows is as updated as
possible. I feel it's got pretty decent instructions for getting running on
XP. I'm not sure how it works on Vista. I would love it if someone could
check this for me.
the setup I've provided is at

I wanted to see how our windows people were doing after last nights
commits.  Is anyone getting build error or having errors thrown when
logging into grid?  I only know of one issue with the delay it takes
to login, pretty sure that is not from our side though.

Subject: [Openviewer-dev] Third Life Milestone 1 Preview Released and Need
	of OpenViewer Expansion
Message-ID: <351467290804202355u6d6ffd25w92c4890d2ca3dcb7@mail.gmail.com>

It's been a busy weekend!  We released a first preview of milestone 1
on winforms under a new UI/Render plugin combination called "Third
Life".  You can download a zip and run OpenViewer.exe from the link
listed on http://code.google.com/p/thirdlife/.  Please note that this
is Windows only for now =)  Here's a list of some of the features we
have:

- Completely modular UI
- Embedded rendering of metaverse
- Ability to send out chat

Sometime this week Jen and I would like to talk with OpenViewer about
expanding the interfaces on the rendering module.  I noticed two
limitations this weekend:

- I'd like to expand the interface to support more input into the
rendering module from the UI ( both keyboard and mouse )
- Also, there isn't a way to pass in resizing events to the renderer
(in cases where usercontrols/windows resize).   This would be very
helpful to us, since we now have a resizable embedded renderer, but no
way to tell ogre3d to resize when our window does ;)

Anyhow, mail me back your thoughts! Thanks

Could whoever has the most recent source for this DLL please commit it
to the source.  I found a bug in it the other day I would like to try
to fix if I see it again, or at least understand. Thanks. =)

Is there any way we can turn off all that  output coming from the SL
model now?  Its very messy.

Message-ID: <204511.65418.qm@web23013.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

the dll (unless someone else has made some changes) is just the code from the open metaverse project svn, with just some minor compile errors fixed, like .Somemethod renamed to .somemethod (or the other way round as it wouldn't compile as it was). When I get home (this weekend) I can email the code with the few changes I did to you, but don't think we should have it in openviewer svn due to it being LGPL. Think its better just to keep our svn as bsd, and either have another svn for libraries or just keep the fractal spline in the meta verse project svn (which actaully is what I suggest so that we don't create a fork of it).
