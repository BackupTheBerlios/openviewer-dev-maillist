Subject: [Openviewer-dev] experimental mxp protocol impl in tracker
Message-ID: <49A5BFB7.7010404@kyperjokki.fi>

very incomplete but already gave some ideas about how implementing
different protocols is and how the abstractions in openviewer work.
http://www.openviewer.org/ticket/71

had issues with python.net vs. the mxp.dll, perhaps related to .net
versions - perhaps someone can test. in fact the dll that's attached to
the patch may not be functional with python.net, but it should be ..
will look that more again soon enough i hope,

now just basically put the code up so that it's somewhere.

did little refactoring in the core to support this, made it optional for
protocols to implement event handlers.
