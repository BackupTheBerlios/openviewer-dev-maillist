Message-ID: <a4280a600803050822q7d7e318dy439984d003173ebe@mail.gmail.com>

1. Where would I use the suggested -pkg option? not when invoking nant, i
know that.

2. I have this package installed: libmono-addins-gui0.2-cil so that is not
the problem.

3. ??

Since openviewer is in such an early stage, though, I will risk it. Let us
think about using Python-Ogre.

* MOGRE "Doesn't work in Linux through Mono." (
http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/MOGRE_Introduction)

* OgreDotNet seems not to exist right now.

* Python-Ogre does exist.

* Many years ago I used Python-OpenGL and was the maintainer for the PyOGL
demos. I wrote an renderer that would draw LOD depending on where the camera
was looking -- including trees which branched fractally when they were
approached. I'll do it again, too.

Hi there Soren,

Thanks for your interest.  I know our mailing lists are a bit empty,
so here is what I know has been said:
* We aren't going to use mogredotnet
* Many people want ogredotnet, and some are trying to revive the
project, some like me want to create a higher level graphics engine
above ogredotnet that we can swigify for openviewer specifically.
* Python is pretty far out of the capabilities of most people in this
project.  I think many of us assume LibSecondLife (C#) is going to be
the primary thing we are building on
* Our repository is horribly broken and often.

My suggestion to you if your interested in some of the popular ideas
going around:
* Learn how to use swig
* Learn how to use GTK#
* Take a look at the Sleek project and see how it uses LibSecondLife

- Daedius

I am interested in openviewer because according to some sources rexviewer is
going to be merging with it. As for "[p]ython is pretty far out of the
capabilities of most people in this
project", perhaps you are attempting to pull my leg. Certainly if python is
beyond them they are not programmers of any kind. It must be the single
easiest language in the world.

Please don't force me to fork the project less than an hour after I joined
it. I exhort you ro reread my previous mail and consider whether you may be
wrong.

The problem lies in our base using libsecondlife, which is in C#.  if
we go with python, then we have a bit of a problem.  We would then
have to write our own networking code from scratch.  I would rather
not re-invent the wheel.  If we can use any language, why not go with
regular Ogre in C++ for example?

There are other reasons for choosing c# though.  CLR makes it easy to
port existing projects to it.  It is a managed language which relieves
us from a lot of work, and headache in the future, many of the
developers in the community prefer it over other languages, to name a
few.

Adam J

I signed up for C#. I'm not interested in learning yet another language just now. But I do know that Pythoneers are very passionate about their language.

I'd suggest if the majority wants C# that you are the one that learn C# instead of everyone learning Python, regardless of how easy it is.

 

If you want to fork because you do not like what the rest have been discussing, then I suggest you do so. Threats like that do not belong in a community like this and will not be taken well.

However if you want to work with us, and make decisions with us, we truly welcome you. New members are always welcome!

Hey all,

In an effort to keep things on OpenViewer mailing list lively.  I
wanted to write you all about my own personal project I'm exploring
and would like to build on top of the OpenViewer platform.  I'm
calling this project "Aether" ( http://code.google.com/p/aether/ ) for
now.  I know many of you all are working on your own personal visions
of what the primary UI module should be, but perhaps you might be
interested in what I have in mind:

Here is my beliefs on the future of metaverses:
- Metaverses are going to be as ubiquitous as web pages one day
- The common person wants a familiar interface to work with
metaverses, and that has not been provided yet by SecondLife or any
other project thus far.
- The future must be cross platform (duh)
- We will never be able to define a UI that everyone wants to use.

With these beliefs in mind,  I plan to make Aether, a mozilla-plugin
metaverse viewer (As a UI module for openviewer).  My hope is to make
use of several technologies for UI and 3D instead of trying to create
my own.  So whats the short goal.

          "Put metaverses inside firefox!"

Simple enough.  What are the implications by this?

1.  We No Longer Define The UI:
Leave this up to the person who runs a website in mozilla.  Everyone
has their own styles and needs.  Why should we be imposing a
standardized UI format on people.  Metaverses ARE not games (which do
have standardized UI), metaverse are interfaces to interacting with
information.  Right now, HTML and friends are king in this area, so
lets not change that.

2.  People Might Be Connected To Multiple Grids At Once or Multiple
Locations in a Single Grid
I might be cruising through an Amazon.com grid , looking at 3D copies
of books while simultaneously  standing in a small room on a Digg.com
grid, yelling at people about the latest stories.  This has
implications for how we need to design openviewer platform.  We must
have multigrid support.  This may even have implications for opensim,
the need to be able to be logged into multiple places on a single
grid.

3. We Need To Think C++
Despite our fondness of .Net.  The real world still uses C++.  Ogre3D,
Mozilla, other technologies are our greatest allies and our greatest
limitations.  I plan to create a build system for Aether than can run
on msys on win32, and osx, and linux.   The big question will be how
much of C++ do we really need.  It is my hope that we can limit it to
just the graphics engine and just the plugin engine.  I love C#, and
want to try to write as much of Aether in C# as possible.

If any of you are interested by this idea, please check out my google
project ( http://code.google.com/p/aether/ ) where I will be hosting
this UI module for openviewer.  I would like to strive as much as
possible to work with the core OpenViewer team to shape a foundation
that can truly be used for any UI on top of it.  Thanks, and remember
to dream big!  Please contact me if your interested in developing this
idea with me =)

Great insight and sounds like an interesting project   We discussed a thin

explore some options, We fussed with Java,  flash and silverlight.   M$ 
codec issues aside for an thin client silverlight / Moonlight looked like

In terms of ogre3d in a browser and getting people to download your client 
there is Clive Jacksons Blink3D active but closed source (ogre has an 
alternative licence) and there is an opensource project that is pretty 
dead called Emma last update 2005   http://emma3d.sourceforge.net/

Hi Peter,

On the subject of a embedded client in a browser. I believe you were involved with Clive Jackson's InDuality plugin, that allowed the Second life client to be used in a browser. But its been a while since I heard anything about this. Do you happen to know what the latest release plans are for that?

In terms of ogre3d in a browser and getting people to download your client there is Clive Jacksons Blink3D active but closed source (ogre has an alternative licence) and there is an opensource project that is pretty dead called Emma last update 2005   http://emma3d.sourceforge.net/

 [Openviewer-dev] Aether UI Project: My Big Vision Of Things To Come 
    

 
 
 
 
Hey all,
 
 In an effort to keep things on OpenViewer mailing list lively.  I
 wanted to write you all about my own personal project I'm exploring
 and would like to build on top of the OpenViewer platform.  I'm
 calling this project "Aether" ( http://code.google.com/p/aether/ ) for
 now.  I know many of you all are working on your own personal visions
 of what the primary UI module should be, but perhaps you might be
 interested in what I have in mind:
 
 Here is my beliefs on the future of metaverses:
 - Metaverses are going to be as ubiquitous as web pages one day
 - The common person wants a familiar interface to work with
 metaverses, and that has not been provided yet by SecondLife or any
 other project thus far.
 - The future must be cross platform (duh)
 - We will never be able to define a UI that everyone wants to use.
 
 With these beliefs in mind,  I plan to make Aether, a mozilla-plugin
 metaverse viewer (As a UI module for openviewer).  My hope is to make
 use of several technologies for UI and 3D instead of trying to create
 my own.  So whats the short goal.
 
           "Put metaverses inside firefox!"
 
 Simple enough.  What are the implications by this?
 
 1.  We No Longer Define The UI:
 Leave this up to the person who runs a website in mozilla.  Everyone
 has their own styles and needs.  Why should we be imposing a
 standardized UI format on people.  Metaverses ARE not games (which do
 have standardized UI), metaverse are interfaces to interacting with
 information.  Right now, HTML and friends are king in this area, so
 lets not change that.
 
 2.  People Might Be Connected To Multiple Grids At Once or Multiple
 Locations in a Single Grid
 I might be cruising through an Amazon.com grid , looking at 3D copies
 of books while simultaneously  standing in a small room on a Digg.com
 grid, yelling at people about the latest stories.  This has
 implications for how we need to design openviewer platform.  We must
 have multigrid support.  This may even have implications for opensim,
 the need to be able to be logged into multiple places on a single
 grid.
 
 3. We Need To Think C++
 Despite our fondness of .Net.  The real world still uses C++.  Ogre3D,
 Mozilla, other technologies are our greatest allies and our greatest
 limitations.  I plan to create a build system for Aether than can run
 on msys on win32, and osx, and linux.   The big question will be how
 much of C++ do we really need.  It is my hope that we can limit it to
 just the graphics engine and just the plugin engine.  I love C#, and
 want to try to write as much of Aether in C# as possible.
 
 If any of you are interested by this idea, please check out my google
 project ( http://code.google.com/p/aether/ ) where I will be hosting
 this UI module for openviewer.  I would like to strive as much as
 possible to work with the core OpenViewer team to shape a foundation
 that can truly be used for any UI on top of it.  Thanks, and remember
 to dream big!  Please contact me if your interested in developing this
 idea with me =)

Thanks for the links Peter =)  I am excited about silverlight as well.  In
fact, I just downloaded the Silverlight 2 beta 2 hours ago, and the first
thing I tried was creating a libsecondlife silverlight assembly library.  It
failed, sadly, there still a bit a ways to go in terms of library support.
But who knows.  LibSecondLife behind a webservice with a silverlight
frontend might be a reality soon.

Subject: [Openviewer-dev] SLeek Interest In GTK# Port as New UI Module for
	OpenViewer
Message-ID: <351467290803071126k3636b249ld7730ce2721dcdaf@mail.gmail.com>

I have been chatting on SLeek Discussion boards with Paul Clement (the
project owner).  I talked a bit with him about the vision of
OpenViewer and our pondering of a GTK# port of SLeek.  He seemed
really interested on making SLeek compatible as a UI module, I invited
him to come by our IRC chat rooms and talk.  I'll repost when I get
more follow up information on a specific date and time.

As mentioned before.  I believe the project offers us a group real
world implementation of the LibSL library, and can help us start a
healthy direction for the foundations of OpenViewer model side.  We
will need to think about a few things:

-  How do we make our platform easily accessible for
creators/developers/maintainers of OpenViewer UIs ( documentation,
APIs, etc).
- What features are we going to need to be successful model side.
Ability to login to multiple grids? Abstraction of configuration  (
not everyone may want to control openviewer by our xml files )
- How can we provide intuitive interfaces between openviewer and the
UI for the various types o f UIs that will come to exist (3D, 2D,
Winforms, Console)?

Let these thoughts stew a bit in your smart creative minds out there =)

Message-ID: <351467290803071130q3cbc2034kb285c4ab611cfdac@mail.gmail.com>

I wanted to put this idea on the mailing list so I do not forget it.
When I came to openviewer,  I  initially did not plan to be working on
3d or GTK# interfaces.   I love automated testing and was the first to
integrate NUnit into the OpenSim project.  My vision was this:

"Functional testing of metaverses is not enough.   If I could simulate
a person using a real viewer.  I might be able to get better results
in automated realtime testing of grids"

A viewer doesnt have to be controlled by a user.  It can be controlled
by a robot ;)  or even replayed.   I figure a Testing UI module down
the line will be very helpful to the opensim community as a whole.
Any thoughts or ideas?  Praise or condemnation?

+1

I think that the Testing UI module could take the form of common/easy 
scripting interface for writing scripts to control the client. IronPython 
maybe? XML?

Also, once this is done, a web-interface for it becomes trivial, if we can 
specify input from a module as well as from various UI elements (keyboards, 
mice, etc)

I like your idea.   My preference is to have nunit tests written.   In
my ideal world, it would be awesome if we could write unit tests that
A) intantiate grids ( on multiple machines even possibly?) B) load up
our tester UI and connect to them , then C) run scripted tests like a
normal user would.    We might be able to have a collection of scripts
written in iron python ( or any other language ), have mono compile
them on the fly, and run them within the unit test.

I during january I was writting a distributed crossplatform build
system that ran tests through master slave architecture, hand off jobs
that were entirely specified trough nant.  My goal was to create a
testing environment for the diverse crossplatform machines opensim was
meant to run on.  The architecture is very similar to BuildBot if that
means anything to you.  I even was able to get realtime results of
builds happening across seperate machines =)  all the test/build
results were available via webservice, and then simply accessed by
PHP.  It was teh awesome.

I'm curious on how IronPython works as a scripting language?  Is it
very crossplatform at this point in time?

Yeah, I meant that developers would have their unit tests, then the scripting 
interface for the client would enable a user to basically click a button and 
have the agent the client was connected to to be moved automatically, taking 
actions like testing inventory, movement, chat, etc.  (Then, not only would 
it be an automated testing interface, but a scripted client for "free" :P)

Yes, I saw that, it was quite interesting :D
Speaking of tests, how is openviewer unittest-wise?

I'd like to say it's cross platform, but the ipy.exe binary has an issue on 
Ubuntu Gutsy where it doesnt display any output to consoles, but will write 
to stdout just fine.  In other words, it's crossplatform enough to not worry 
about it.  (Personally I think IronPython is blasphemy, but I'd rather see a 
scriptable interface in a Python language than in VB.NET :P)

Some special case I've thought of:
Use OpenViewer to (off-screen) render the view of multiple avatars,
possible two renderings per avatar with slightly different offsets. Then
feed the picture into an ANN for processing. :)

Hey all,

In an effort to keep things on OpenViewer mailing list lively.  I
wanted to write you all about my own personal project I'm exploring
and would like to build on top of the OpenViewer platform.  I'm
calling this project "Aether" ( http://code.google.com/p/aether/ ) for
now.  I know many of you all are working on your own personal visions
of what the primary UI module should be, but perhaps you might be
interested in what I have in mind:

Here is my beliefs on the future of metaverses:
- Metaverses are going to be as ubiquitous as web pages one day
- The common person wants a familiar interface to work with
metaverses, and that has not been provided yet by SecondLife or any
other project thus far.
- The future must be cross platform (duh)
- We will never be able to define a UI that everyone wants to use.

With these beliefs in mind,  I plan to make Aether, a mozilla-plugin
metaverse viewer (As a UI module for openviewer).  My hope is to make
use of several technologies for UI and 3D instead of trying to create
my own.  So whats the short goal.

          "Put metaverses inside firefox!"

Simple enough.  What are the implications by this?

1.  We No Longer Define The UI:
Leave this up to the person who runs a website in mozilla.  Everyone
has their own styles and needs.  Why should we be imposing a
standardized UI format on people.  Metaverses ARE not games (which do
have standardized UI), metaverse are interfaces to interacting with
information.  Right now, HTML and friends are king in this area, so
lets not change that.

2.  People Might Be Connected To Multiple Grids At Once or Multiple
Locations in a Single Grid
I might be cruising through an Amazon.com grid , looking at 3D copies
of books while simultaneously  standing in a small room on a Digg.com
grid, yelling at people about the latest stories.  This has
implications for how we need to design openviewer platform.  We must
have multigrid support.  This may even have implications for opensim,
the need to be able to be logged into multiple places on a single
grid.

3. We Need To Think C++
Despite our fondness of .Net.  The real world still uses C++.  Ogre3D,
Mozilla, other technologies are our greatest allies and our greatest
limitations.  I plan to create a build system for Aether than can run
on msys on win32, and osx, and linux.   The big question will be how
much of C++ do we really need.  It is my hope that we can limit it to
just the graphics engine and just the plugin engine.  I love C#, and
want to try to write as much of Aether in C# as possible.

If any of you are interested by this idea, please check out my google
project ( http://code.google.com/p/aether/ ) where I will be hosting
this UI module for openviewer.  I would like to strive as much as
possible to work with the core OpenViewer team to shape a foundation
that can truly be used for any UI on top of it.  Thanks, and remember
to dream big!  Please contact me if your interested in developing this
idea with me =)

What makes it n00b?
The point of it is to allow OpenSim and OpenViewer to be key components
in the ongoing effort/research surrounding ANN/AGI. I will not be our
redeemer, I lack both the brain/capacity/knowledge and time/dedication.
But I can do my part in providing some of the tools.

Good question: Ken-doll appearance, non-prim hair, proliffic use of
"u" and "r".  High bump/avatar-plow rate ;)

Hello,

You may need to install the gtk-sharp2-gapi package, or some similar
gtk-sharp package depending on your distribution.  Also, in the latest
revision's prebuild.xml, the path to the gtk-sharp-2.0 is hard-coded,
so if yours differs, you may need to modify this.

HTH,
Jeff

MonoDevelop cannot compile the sln made with the current prebuild.
This simple fix will enable compilation.  the ".dll" extension is
important!

So, here's a few things i'm trying to redesign on the login window:
- the ability to choose a different grid quickly and easily (with
defaults for LL grid, osgrid, etc).
- the ability to set your starting location information
- the ability to save your password
- the ability to select from a list of avatar names you've previously
logged in as

Attached in the patch with my beta final design of the login control.
Note, none of the features above are working yet.  Please tell me what
you think! Please either apply the patch, or look below at my
screenshot =)

Here is a patch for the newly LGPLed fractal spline source code.
There are various dependendencies it has, which i'm not sure we are
going to entirely want to use.  For now, here is the source code =)
Enjoy.  Let me know your thoughts.

Message-ID: <351467290803201251h48a792e7q407c1a41ebcec198@mail.gmail.com>

This patch includes changes for adding an nunit testing project for
the SL Protocol.  Right now I just test login but I think its a great
first start.  You will need the nunit.framework.dll binary from nunit
website ( get the .net 2.0 version )

Compile as normal.

to run tests

cd bin
nunit-console2 OpenViewer.Protocol.SL.Tests.dll

I created a test account named Open Viewer to run our tests with.

Enjoy!

Hello,

Thanks!  Most of these changes have been applied.

I changed the default grid for the tests from osgrid to localhost,
though.  I'm not sure what the osgrid feeling is about unit testing
bots.  There could also be login conflicts with people running tests
simultaneously.

I tried changing from Login to BeginLogin, but then ogredotnet didn't
render anything, though it appears that the OnConnected event fires.
Not sure why this is happening.  (Incidentally, I'm working on
changing the way the OgreDotNet engine starts up, so it's not creating
two additional windows, and that may resolve this issue....)

The console engine seems to work fine using BeginLogin, though, so
maybe it's only ogredotnet.  Attached is Daedius's patch with just the
login change.  Could someone try it out and see if this happens with
mogre, or with ogredotnet on linux?

Jeff

OSGrid doesnt mind unit test bots as long as they're for projects like 
openviewer :P

But changing the default grid to log in to is a very good idea for the reasons 
you stated.  
If you'd like to use OSGrid for unit testing, feel free, just use an account 
that only you have access to, if only for your own sanity :P

Thank you so much Jeff =)

Yes, I also talked with CKrinke about my test bots on OSGrid.  I
should have mentioned this last email. He seemed quite happy to have
OSGrid tested in any way.  Perhaps one day we can setup our own sim
there.  We can automate a strip club so I finally have some place to
give all my Lindens! ;) That would be nice. Thanks again.

Subject: [Openviewer-dev] Fractal Spline: What it does, What remaining to do,
	Things that were most challenging
Message-ID: <351467290803210937g68e4f5d9ic0a04be5e0340992@mail.gmail.com>

Forwarding a transcript of an email conversation with Hugh Perkins
------------------------------
Interested in hearing about what you guys are doing.  By the way, I
dont know if there's much documentation about how fractalspline works.
 It's not very fractal or anything.

What it does is (if I remember rightly):
- we have a class that represents a cross-section
- you feed it points, for example a triangle has three points (gotta
love tortology :-D ), but I mean, like a prism would have a triangle
cross-section, and hence 3 points
- we then extrude that class a certain distance, with a certain
constant rotational and translational change as it extrudes.

- higher level classes, like Box, Prism (?) contain the extrusion class
- they also have a function to draw the "end-caps" at either end of
the extrusion

There are two types of extrusions: linear, and rotational
- rotational rotates the cross section around an axis, rather than
extruding linearly
- the translational and rotational change during extrusion still
applies for rotational extrusions
- as does cut

Textures work, cut works, rotation and translation works.  We also
have holes that are the same shape as their cross-section (eg
triangular hole in triangular cross section).

Remaining to do:
- advanced stuff that was created in SecondLife after fractalspline
came out (spirals and stuff)
- holes that are a different shape to the cross section (circular hole
in prism for example)
- may be a couple of bugs with texture rotation on the end caps (?)

Things that were most challenging:
- surprisingly the extrusion part is easy-peasy
- getting the end-caps right, and the textures on them, is quite challenging
- if I remember rightly, the main challenge with making a circular
hole in a prism is being able to draw the end-caps correctly.

Yesterday I heard a problem with people compiling getting an error
about VersionInfo.  This is the second time i've heard this error.
I've had problems compiling the source code before with errors related
to VersionInfo too myself (I thought I just checked out when the build
was broken).  Maybe it is something special to certain versions of
visual studio/.net combinations. I'm going to try creating a pure
virtual machine to simulate this problem and also verify the steps I
believe are necessary in order to compile OpenViewer.

Cool... could you attach the patch?  Or open a bug on mantis and

Message-ID: <f38794ad0803221156s3a5a7c2bqc4220a08719ffbbf@mail.gmail.com>

Adds logging to startup process. Just a list of the settings that have been
set before the application runs.

Subject: [Openviewer-dev] GTK MVC Has Arrived
Message-ID: <351467290803231013n75514a51n42a1c7954ec8cd3@mail.gmail.com>

This patch is a massive reworking of the GTK UI in order to make it
inline with MVC design patterns as well as several new features:
- New UserSettings.xml file
- Storing of recent grids visited
- Storing of recent locations used
- Storing of recent usernames used
- Storage of passwords for quick reuse
- Various UI fixes
- Design prototype for console panel and chat panel

I am very happy about how GTK is going  A week ago, I was a hardcore
winforms guy, but GTK seems very capable for making high quality UI we
will need for OpenViewer.  My only problem with it is the non-thread
safe nature of GTK, which will take a little getting used to to
perform certain tasks.  But, where there is a will there is a way.
And I think applications like Mono Develop are already proof that it
can be done.

Additionally i'd like to say I'm very happy how I was able to
implement MVC pattern for GTK.  View, model, controller seperation
worked really well with GTK. The view is very stupid in code as it
should be and there is no logic in the view.  Anyhow, apply the patch,
and tell me how you like it.  Enjoy!

GTK is cool.  It's multi-platform, as are the utilities you need to create
reasonable-looking UIs, ie Glade.  It's also quite easy to use.

Hello Openviewers.  I wanted to write you all an email on the state of
all things GTK related.  First of all, we've had alot of great
progress over the last weekend, and I thank the many people for
putting together the ideas and contributions to help get GTK UI
started right!  To name a few of the things we now have:

- The foundations of a UserSettings
- A solid MVC pattern behind the GTK UI ( code manageability )
- Login sleekness (dropdown boxes of recent grids, etc.)

I want to organize and pave the way for what i'm envisioning as the
first milestone of GTK UI:
- Login Screen
- Chat Screen ( Local Chat/IM/Group Chat)
- OpenViewer Capabilities Management
- UserSettings
- Settings Screen
- Bonus Feature: 3D Integration ( if its possible, if not, having an
external window will be fine ) =o

Anyhow, there is wiki page for GTK UI Milestone 1
(http://www.openviewer.org/index.php/GTKUIMilestone1) I will keep open
for a day or so.  Please help by contributing your ideas and thoughts
to Milestone 1 here or on the wiki. Have a great week!

I believe there was some problem with the UserSettings? was that how you
wanted to store the recent grids, locations and usernames? can I get a copy
of this?

Chi11ken made a change last night to how UserSettings works.  I'm not
sure exactly what though.  I believe they might be autogenerated now
the first time you login.  Chi11ken, can you communicate your changes?

Message-ID: <f38794ad0803241459w77117409v13ea6eca7552562a@mail.gmail.com>

I wanted to update the Winforms to make it similar to what's been done on
the gtk side. I also didn't want to over write _MW's stuff that he already
did.so right now it'll load if you ask for WinForms2 as the ui_engine. The
biggest reason why I don't want it to be a replacement right away is because
_MW mentioned that he was working on something that would add rendering to
the WinForms window. Once that's in I can add it to mine and I think things
will be cool from there.

It sounds like you're envisioning a separate tab in the notebook
control for each of these functions.  I was thinking more along the
lines of a Firefox for virtual worlds -- one main viewing window, an
address bar, and windows accessible through the menu bar for things
like setting preferences, etc.  (And perhaps tabbed browsing, with
support for multiple virtual world connections simultaneously)

One of the major goals of this project, though, is to be highly
customizable, so if someone wants to totally rewrite the UI, it's a
fairly simple task.  We just provide a default implementation (or
multiple defaults -- a browser-like skin, a FPS-like skin, etc.)

To keep it customizable, we should limit, or at least explicitly
define, the dependencies between the .glade file and the code (i.e.,
what widgets are expected to exist, and what types and names they
should have).

Another thing to keep in mind is that at some point in the distant
future, the UI may be partially specified by the server, so you can
log into a FPS or a virtual conference with the same viewer and get a
UI appropriate to each.

+1 to this, I too envision a kind of firefox approach, with the address bar etc. Although I was also thinking of the main viewing window as being separated into two, the 3d portion and a 2d side bar that could have context specific things in, like when in build mode, it would have the build icons etc in it. At another time it could have a embedded web browser. also plugins could define panels that could be displayed in there when that plugin is active/selected.

I don't think we want to have separate tabs for everything, and having to swap between tabs to do something like chat.

But above all, like Jeff said, it needs to be expandable. Modules need to be able to include their own GUI panel that is integrated into the ui when they are in use.

I don't think the openviewer should look like firefox, and I don't
think it should look like all tabs.

Firstly, I think the address bar is useless.  How often do you think a
person is going to be manually typing in metaverse URLs?  It's only
going to take up space.  90% of the time a user is only going to log
into one or two grids manually and that might be it.  And when they
do, it should be automated or easy for them to log in a second time
without the use of an address bar.  If we wanted to do URL handling of
metaverse URLs ( say when someone clicks something in the REAL
firefox), we can, I just don't think a dedicated addressbar is useful.
 Connection settings are more complex than just URL, and i'm just
plain lazy and wouldn't want to type it out every time or deal with it
in string form.  I think the majority of average users would agree.

I envision open viewer being more like X-Chat.  If any of you are
familiar with that software.

Here is a picture of the main view:
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3044/2360641855_c22e80af76_o.png  . The
chat area of the screen would be our 3D view area.  I think the area
on the right would make a good communications/inventory area.  And the
area on the left could make a good context sensitive control area like
Michael was mentioning ( for build tools or what not ).  Everything
else would be accessable via menus as Jeff suggested.

Take here and look how they do connections.  Basically, there is a
window that accessable via the menu called Network List.(
http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2397/2361474720_0fa170983c_o.png ) This
is where you manage all your networks you normally connect to, as well
as suggest networks that might be interesting.  I can edit a network
to give it more specific settings  (
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2360642035_344b729ce9_o.png ).  I
can specify login servers, passwords, certain rooms to join, and set
X-Chat to automatically connect to certain networks on startup.

I imagine we can use X-Chat metaphors very directly.

I really want to see a address bar, while it might not fit all needs, for some it will be good. And thats what openviewer should be about, making it flexibly so it can fit as many different needs as possible.

I don't see one or two big grids, I still see lots and lots of smaller "grids" (hate that term). While yes some of them will have links between them and you might be able to use the same account on more than one. We should not think of big monolithic grids. Different applications have different requirements We should think of 3d websites. That is the basis of opensim and it should be of openviewer, other wise openviewer loses its appeal for use as a viewer for custom 3d applications. So yes I want to see tabs (meaning can be on more than one "grid" at same time) as well, but that can come later.

 But please lets not restrict openviewer to only be used on big grids that you sign into and then stay on that grid for quite a while then are most likely going to close down the viewer. That just not how I see things working. And I really hope things don't turn out that way.

As for the url, well some "grids" won't need passwords etc, so it would just be something like "MW at login.newgrid.com" and the ones that need a password can pop up a box for that to be entered. 


I'm also against having a "hard coded" area for inventory etc. It should all be modular and just generic areas in which different panels can be placed, either my the user or the startup application settings or maybe the region you are connected to. Not all applications/regions are going to require/want inventory is the sense that it exists today, so let not make anything like that hard coded.

plain lazy and wouldn't want to type it out every time or deal with it
in string form.  I think the majority of average users would agree.

I envision open viewer being more like X-Chat.  If any of you are
familiar with that software.

Here is a picture of the main view:
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3044/2360641855_c22e80af76_o.png  . The
chat area of the screen would be our 3D view area.  I think the area
on the right would make a good communications/inventory area.  And the
area on the left could make a good context sensitive control area like
Michael was mentioning ( for build tools or what not ).  Everything
else would be accessable via menus as Jeff suggested.

Take here and look how they do connections.  Basically, there is a
window that accessable via the menu called Network List.(
http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2397/2361474720_0fa170983c_o.png ) This
is where you manage all your networks you normally connect to, as well
as suggest networks that might be interesting.  I can edit a network
to give it more specific settings  (
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2360642035_344b729ce9_o.png ).  I
can specify login servers, passwords, certain rooms to join, and set
X-Chat to automatically connect to certain networks on startup.

I imagine we can use X-Chat metaphors very directly.

Yes, I agree.  It ought to be possible to link to your sim from Facebook and
so on.

Random idea: maybe even embed a webcam from your sim into Facebook.

+1 for Daedius and his thoughts. We are heading into the unknown a bit and our paradigms they will be a shifting a bit.

For one use case, that is a secondlife-type application, a viewer similar in its user interface to secondlife is a good thing.

There will be other use cases that do use URL's as our vision of a 3-D browsing world may come to pass, so perhaps we need to accomodate both these and other notions. 

Maybe a core OpenViewer with plugins using a similar strategy to OpenSim is appropriate. In any case, at this point, I would say, let it evolve and all the personalities on this channel will have an affect on how it looks.

Certainly Mw's is one of the most important voices and I dont want my comments to be construed as negative against those, but I like Daedius thoughts and want to encourage him.

I don't think the openviewer should look like firefox, and I don't
think it should look like all tabs.

Firstly, I think the address bar is useless.  How often do you think a
person is going to be manually typing in metaverse URLs?  It's only
going to take up space.  90% of the time a user is only going to log
into one or two grids manually and that might be it.  And when they
do, it should be automated or easy for them to log in a second time
without the use of an address bar.  If we wanted to do URL handling of
metaverse URLs ( say when someone clicks something in the REAL
firefox), we can, I just don't think a dedicated addressbar is useful.
 Connection settings are more complex than just URL, and i'm just
plain lazy and wouldn't want to type it out every time or deal with it
in string form.  I think the majority of average users would agree.

plus 1 on the URL idea.  Though, I think the joy of having a
customizable UI allows us to not fight about it, an let the massws
decide.

I think if we can let each grid send out a UI efinition to the client
it would be ideal.  Be it html, xml, or whatever.

Looks good, but some time in the future can we please have an option to 
disable that wait time in the ini?  I like splash screens and all, but having

Hey Gryc, thanks for testing. I reduced the time a bit in a new patch.
Hehe, yah, in the future its going to be doing something useful like
loading application settings files, preparing our complex screens.
etc. =] Glad you like it.

Message-ID: <351467290803252145q177b1518t96216afd49f4823e@mail.gmail.com>

I have another patch for review for possible inclusion into the trunk.
 https://developer.berlios.de/mantis/view.php?id=52  It includes the
elimination of a lot of our interfaces so that people aren't scared of
ever modifying GtkUI.  It also includes a redesign of the GTK window.
The login box is now accessible from the menu, and there is a mock
address bar.  Tell me your thoughts! =)

I'm not a fan X-chat UI at all, but I think that its possible to allow
people to easily switch between many smallish virtual worlds as easily
as with the web without making it look like Firefox.

In fact a hybrid of the two UIs, and what I had in mind, might look more
like Pidgin:

- A small session-wide window lists 

  1. The avatars you posses, and the VW they were last logged into. You
click on an avatar and you log into the last know VW. Avatar portability
would make this menu moot.

  2. The distinct grids (SL,HiPiHi,etc) you hold distinct accounts in.
You click on one and you log into it. OpenID would make this menu moot.

  3. A list of "bookmarked" locations, represented by a URI, presented
in menu form. After all there will be less VWs than there are web pages,
and less moving in between them. It makes less sense to force people to
type URIs.

- When a login happens, a 3D display screen comes up -- with tabs if
you're logged into more than one or with more than one avatar.

Cheers,

The idea of menus and configuration sounds a little outdated and not 
exactly user friendly just  to enter a virtual world or someone's grid. 
Here is a vid from when a demo I gave at virtual worlds 2007.

Yes, I agree.  It ought to be possible to link to your sim from Facebook 
and so on.

Random idea: maybe even embed a webcam from your sim into Facebook.

Thanks for the link Nink,

I think if openviewer ever became an embedded plugin into a firefox
browser and was the focus of connecting into a single metaverse, you'd
be correct.   Honestly though, open viewer as it looks like now with
GTK UI is going to be used to connect into a variety of different
types of grids.  Each with specific settings and saved or not saved
passwords.  While using a URL as a shortcut into the whole process is
beneficial, a user still might need more configuration over how they
are connecting and how they interact with features the grid may offer.
 I guess i'm just not sure why you think menus and settings can be
tossed out the door ;)  Thanks for the vid though.

Message-ID: <351467290803260840j598630c5g36f1280f584e9b9c@mail.gmail.com>

GTK UI Milestone 1 has been formalized.  Thank you to everyone for
their ideas!  Let me know if you really have a burning desire to take
ownership of one of these ideas.  Otherwise, I'll be handing out tasks
or working on them myself  =)  Happy hacking everyone!

http://www.openviewer.org/index.php/GTKUIMilestone1

    * Get a good looking logo for OV
    * Provide a setting to override splash screen
    * Get a good looking about box in its own view
    * Complete the connection settings to make like pidgin
    * Get local chat working
    * Drop glade, glade has too many bugs, and in the end, we'll need
our views to be specified in GTK for dockability and proper seperation
    * Be able to safely store passwords in user settings
    * Move user settings downward in UI project
    * Get an address bar working with simple "mtvs://daedius
moskvitch at osgrid.org", should prompt for password if we don't have one
saved and connect
    * Keyboard shortcuts
    * Icons
    * Documentation

Note, if your idea didn't make it into this round, we'll likely be
getting to it next milestone.  The goal of this round is to make
something reasonable and achievable!  Let's do it!

Hi Daedius

Thanks for the feedback.  I am probably completely off base here (I 
usually get it wrong).  My logic was to take a "how would Steve Jobs 
create a 3D browser for an Apple" approach.    What  I was trying to 
convey was the concept of leveraging and working within the 3D immersive 
space versus an external or overlay 2D menu systems. 

Example: 
Your in Deepgrid on fantasy island  at coordinates 123.452.205 and you 
render a new door.  The door automatically configures itself for the 
appropriate information (Same as a landmark today but with additional 
server information and settings).  A copy of the door is stored in a local 
database on your PC as well as in world. 

Later that day meet someone in  OSGrid tell them about your place and 
render the door you made.  They walk through the door and are in OSgrid at 
your house. (Check out croquet) 

I fully agree we absolutely need to be able to configure and customize 
settings (click on door up pops an in world control panel and enter all 
the settings)  but hopefully that's rare as it's so much easier from the 
user perspective if they simply walk through a pre configured door. 

In terms of all the other configurations could this all be made just as 
intuitive using an in world 3D control panel with a bunch of prims on it.  
Click on the phone prim to configure voice, click on sun prim to configure 
sky click on a voice prim to chat, camera prim for camera etc etc.   This 
way even my Mother could use it and if she needed help she could render up 
her control panel give me access then watch as I show her how to do 
something. 

Anyway just food for thought.

Hey there Nini,

Thanks for your mind opening email! I don't know if you know or not,
but I am a Steve Jobs fanboy ;)  You are entirely correct about your
vision.  I need to put this in a "Great Ideas list" (
http://www.openviewer.org/index.php/Ideas ):  Communication between in
world objects and the actual application OpenViewer itself.

Another simple patch. This allows the user to change the login strings and
press the login again after a failed login. It also notifies the user of a
failed login.

Hey there powers that be,

I was wondering if I could get berlios bug powers to assign
bugs/features to people so D-Font and I and others can start dolling
out things to take ownership of GTK UI tasks.   SVN access would be
nice too, as I know D-Font and I generate alot of backlog of work for
ya'll! =)

I've volunteered to work on a logo for OpenViewer since I happen to be a 
self-proclaimed SVG ninja.  Does anyone have any ideas for a logo or any 
other little icons that may need created? 

(https://developer.berlios.de/mantis/view.php?id=54 is the relevant bug I hope

I think we need these things:
- splash screen
- app icon
- icon to represent an "avatar/person" for the avatar list for the chat feature
- perhaps an icon to represent a "grid"

As for what to make for a design for OV, I can only think of Circles
and Triangles! =()

I think that for these icons, especially for ones that go on buttons, we could 
look at the Tango iconset.  For example, I'd use the "system-users" icon to 
represent the avatar list, and then use an icon like "internet-web-browser" 
to represent the grid.

... and then we could just invert the triangles to point inwards, and we have the OpenSim logo. (as in, the client talks to many different services, the services accept many different clients)

As far as I know, we should only need to configure log4net once in the
application.  This is currently done in the Application, as soon as we
start up.

Thanks!  Added in r233.

(BTW, it might be easier to track patches on mantis than on the
mailing list.  It also allows larger file attachments.)

Sounds interesting, if a little confusing to the end-user who has to find that 
particular icon in his programs menu...I'm all for it if they can be 
distinguished at 16x16 px.
