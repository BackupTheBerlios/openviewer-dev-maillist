<PRE>I completely agree with MW on this one.  I know some of the patches
going in are a little slow, but we want to take the time to really
review everything to make sure that everything is of top quality.  We
are at the very early stages of development in this project, and it's
building up the core of OpenViewer.  If we rush things in, then we
will end up doing countless rewrites.   I would like to avoid that as
much as possible.

As MW said, we were actively working on moving the SVN to it's own set
of servers, and expanding commit access to some that have shown good
quality patches.  I will continue to support this specific project,
and not the google code project, and I hope everyone else can agree
with that as well.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This mailing list thread is to start discussion on server migration.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have two problems that are a hindrance to the progression of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenViewer, and I speak of them with great humbleness and respect to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the people who have been working on OpenViewer:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - There are not enough active people to sustain patch inclusion,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checking, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - We cannot easily grow the active people who are committers because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of our connection to opensim (many of our contributors happen to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coders of both projects)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The plan D-Font and myself are going to pursue is for the betterment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of our group. We believe that a transition to a new source code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; repository location is the answer. We have formed a group on Google
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code, which provides free SVN access to groups. There are benefits
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and cons to this solution which we will pursue:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Benefits:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Non-connection with OpenSim, allowing both projects to add new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; members without risk of trashing the others code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Free hosting for SVN
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Little maintenance for running source code repository
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Many users have gmail accounts or can easily obtain them for use if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they become members
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - free source code browsing and search
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cons:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Only gmail accounts may be used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Does not provide offerings of git for developers interested ( we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to set this up elsewhere )
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please note that this change in source repository will not change the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; policy of our group on adding new members to get commit access (in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenSim tradition). Additionally, all old members with commit access
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will get access as members of the Google code group. Myself,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Daedius,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and D-Font will be administering this google code project and thusly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have code access as well unless there is some great outcry against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We will be making the transition after some discussion of SVN
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structure layout, and then update the wiki accordingly. If you have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any ideas, objections, praises on this topic, please feel free to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; post
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them below! This transition will be made on Wednesday, April 9th,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unless we have great objection in the following discussion. If you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are an existing committer, please send either D-Font or myself your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gmail contact information and you will be added promptly. Lastly, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is not blatantly clear, this is not an effort to fork openviewer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our unity is one of our greatest strengths. Thanks and happy coding!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Daedius
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For my own 2-cents, I can say that I feel that every new project lives and
</I>&gt;<i> dies by its active developers, and that if OpenViewer wants to live, it
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be more open to accepting more contributors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
