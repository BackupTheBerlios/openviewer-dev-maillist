<PRE>Yes we all agreed that openviewer needs to move to a new server and have more commiters and we were actively working towards moving it to a new server. 

However I'm afraid when a group of people just take it on themselves to move it and set themselves up as the admins of the new project then thats really a fork and thats how I at this time feel about this.

&gt;<i> Hello Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This mailing list thread is to start discussion on server migration.
</I>&gt;<i> We have two problems that are a hindrance to the progression of
</I>&gt;<i> OpenViewer, and I speak of them with great humbleness and respect to
</I>&gt;<i> the people who have been working on OpenViewer:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - There are not enough active people to sustain patch inclusion,
</I>&gt;<i> checking, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> - We cannot easily grow the active people who are committers because
</I>&gt;<i> of our connection to opensim (many of our contributors happen to be
</I>&gt;<i> coders of both projects)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The plan D-Font and myself are going to pursue is for the betterment
</I>&gt;<i> of our group.  We believe that a transition to a new source code
</I>&gt;<i> repository location is the answer.  We have formed a group on Google
</I>&gt;<i> code, which provides free SVN access to groups.  There are benefits
</I>&gt;<i> and cons to this solution which we will pursue:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Benefits:
</I>&gt;<i> - Non-connection with OpenSim, allowing both projects to add new
</I>&gt;<i> members without risk of trashing the others code
</I>&gt;<i> - Free hosting for SVN
</I>&gt;<i> - Little maintenance for running source code repository
</I>&gt;<i> - Many users have gmail accounts or can easily obtain them for use if
</I>&gt;<i> they become members
</I>&gt;<i> - free source code browsing and search
</I>&gt;<i> Cons:
</I>&gt;<i> - Only gmail accounts may be used
</I>&gt;<i> - Does not provide offerings of git for developers interested ( we
</I>&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;<i> have to set this up elsewhere )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please note that this change in source repository will not change the
</I>&gt;<i> policy of our group on adding new members to get commit access (in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim tradition).  Additionally, all old members with commit access
</I>&gt;<i> will get access as members of the Google code group.  Myself,
</I>&gt;<i> Daedius,
</I>&gt;<i> and D-Font will be administering this google code project and thusly
</I>&gt;<i> have code access as well unless there is some great outcry against
</I>&gt;<i> us.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We will be making the transition after some discussion of SVN
</I>&gt;<i> structure layout, and then update the wiki accordingly.  If you have
</I>&gt;<i> any ideas, objections, praises on this topic, please feel free to
</I>&gt;<i> post
</I>&gt;<i> them below! This transition will be made on Wednesday, April 9th,
</I>&gt;<i> unless we have great objection in the following discussion.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> are an existing committer, please send either D-Font or myself your
</I>&gt;<i> gmail contact information and you will be added promptly.  Lastly, if
</I>&gt;<i> it is not blatantly clear, this is not an effort to fork openviewer.
</I>&gt;<i> Our unity is one of our greatest strengths.  Thanks and happy coding!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Daedius
</I>
For my own 2-cents, I can say that I feel that every new project lives and dies by its active developers, and that if OpenViewer wants to live, it needs to be more open to accepting more contributors.

Cheers,
