<PRE>Just to explain what my biggest problem with this is. 
 It relates to one of your sentences: 

&quot;Please note that this change in source repository will not change the
policy of our group on adding new members to get commit access (in the
OpenSim tradition).&quot;

Basically in my view, this has been broke at least four times in what has happened here.
We have that policy on Core members voting for new memember and any other big decision.

Two in yourself and D-front becoming core members without that vote. Another one in you both being the admins without a vote.
And in the project being moved to google without a vote. Now its very possible that all of these things would have got a go ahead after a vote. 
But those votes weren't held so it broke that policy and hurt trust. 

So I have to consider this google project a fork. That should change its name to something other than openviewer.

This mailing list thread is to start discussion on server migration.
We have two problems that are a hindrance to the progression of
OpenViewer, and I speak of them with great humbleness and respect to
the people who have been working on OpenViewer:

- There are not enough active people to sustain patch inclusion, checking, etc.
- We cannot easily grow the active people who are committers because
of our connection to opensim (many of our contributors happen to be
coders of both projects)

The plan D-Font and myself are going to pursue is for the betterment
of our group.  We believe that a transition to a new source code
repository location is the answer.  We have formed a group on Google
code, which provides free SVN access to groups.  There are benefits
and cons to this solution which we will pursue:

Benefits:
- Non-connection with OpenSim, allowing both projects to add new
members without risk of trashing the others code
- Free hosting for SVN
- Little maintenance for running source code repository
- Many users have gmail accounts or can easily obtain them for use if
they become members
- free source code browsing and search
Cons:
- Only gmail accounts may be used
- Does not provide offerings of git for developers interested ( we may
have to set this up elsewhere )

Please note that this change in source repository will not change the
policy of our group on adding new members to get commit access (in the
OpenSim tradition).  Additionally, all old members with commit access
will get access as members of the Google code group.  Myself, Daedius,
and D-Font will be administering this google code project and thusly
have code access as well unless there is some great outcry against us.

We will be making the transition after some discussion of SVN
structure layout, and then update the wiki accordingly.  If you have
any ideas, objections, praises on this topic, please feel free to post
them below! This transition will be made on Wednesday, April 9th,
unless we have great objection in the following discussion.  If you
are an existing committer, please send either D-Font or myself your
gmail contact information and you will be added promptly.  Lastly, if
it is not blatantly clear, this is not an effort to fork openviewer.
Our unity is one of our greatest strengths.  Thanks and happy coding!

- Daedius
