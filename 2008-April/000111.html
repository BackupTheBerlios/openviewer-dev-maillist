<PRE>Hello,

I'm sure this is done with the best of intentions.  However, splitting
off from the core team, starting your own repository, adding
committers, and then emailing the list announcing it and telling the
core developers that they should express their opinions on the matter
by tomorrow, or else it goes through, is not likely to be received well.

&gt;<i> Please note that this change in source repository will not change the
</I>&gt;<i> policy of our group on adding new members to get commit access (in the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim tradition).  Additionally, all old members with commit access
</I>&gt;<i> will get access as members of the Google code group.  Myself, Daedius,
</I>&gt;<i> and D-Font will be administering this google code project and thusly
</I>&gt;<i> have code access as well unless there is some great outcry against us.
</I>
As MW pointed out, this already breaks the policy of adding new
members to the group.  Following this example, anyone who wants access
in the future could just clone the repository, add themselves and
whoever else they want, and declare that the new official home of
OpenViewer.  In essence, you *are* forking the code.

&gt;<i> There are not enough active people to sustain patch inclusion,
</I>&gt;<i> checking, etc.
</I>
I see two open patches in mantis, both of which have been reviewed and
are waiting on some kind of issue.  I don't see any that are waiting
on a core developer.

Of course, having more active developers is helpful, and I don't think
anyone on this project is averse to accepting more contributors
(though of course I speak only for myself).

Until the logistic issues are resolved, though, I'd recommend we simply
continue with the existing methods of tracking and applying patches.

Jeff
