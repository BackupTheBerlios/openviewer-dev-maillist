Subject: [Openviewer-dev] testing list, info about OS-X
Message-ID: <818463.13731.qm@web57802.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

thought I would test whether this list is actually operational, since I haven't seen any traffic.

I'm successfully fiddling away with Python-Ogre on Windows and Linux, but I think it's really important that we have 3-plat support from the get-go to the degree possible.  With that in mind, I've been watching the p-og list with an eye on Mac support.  He's a recent thread that looks promising:

http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2addons/viewtopic.php?t=6853

I should point out that I spent a good part of a week trying without success to build on either Windows or Ubuntu.  This is a *very* difficult project to get building -- it's a perfect storm of multiple libraries, multiple languages, multiple make environments, and limited attention from the devs on ease of build.  They're trying, but they have a difficult job on their hands.  I would allocate at least a *full week*, meaning hours a day for many days, if you expect to get this going -- unless you are a true build stud, in which case a coffee-injected 24-hour marathon may do it (but then no time for feedback from the lists).

I've been working with the binaries on win/unix, and concentrating on what I care about, which is getting the viewer going.  More on that soon, hopefully.

In Mantis#2290 is a small patch that needs looking at. It is from a new submitter that has submitted two small patches that apply cleanly. This one involves some of the module loading and I would appreciate a note from another core-developer regarding how we wish to proceed.

did you mean to send this to the openviewer list?  Sounds like an opensim bug.  We haven't written enough code here to get to bug report #1, much less 2K!

Hi danx0r,

For what it's worth, I did send a bug report and a patch to the C# openviewer a couple months ago :)

http://openviewer.org/ticket/27

I'm not sure it's of any relevance anymore though, since it looks like the python openviewer is now the active project.

trying to run -r 360 --

result:  lots of console output; finally an ogre window appears.  In the window, I see a Ninja warrior standing on the default terrain island.  Then the ogre window goes monochrome, and everything is unresponsive.  I see no wx gui or any other widgets (wxogre is installed).

Previous version didn't go gray, and ctl-C would log me out.  This version, ctl-C just quickly closes ogre and dumps me back the console (no proper logout).

I'd like to get this working and make some contributions.  I think I can get basic bounding-box prims working, perhaps some camera movement.  However I can't get far until I know it's working normally, which apparently it isn't yet.  It would be helpful if the readme could include a description of what level of functionality is expected for each release.

thoughts?

Hello,

It should now be running in a wx window, though so far there are no
menubars or other widgets, so it looks pretty much like the Ogre
window did.

After it logs in successfully, it should start the rendering window.
Terrain loads somewhat slowly, patch by patch.  Then the ninja avatar
should appear (though this has failed from time to time for me).  The
camera should be pointed at the avatar, and if the avatar's position
changes through terrain changes or such, the camera should shift as
well.

The Wx UI doesn't exit gracefully yet, so Ctrl-C will leave you logged
in until your session times out.

I haven't seen any problems with it going monochrome.  It is generally
fairly unresponsive in general, just due to lack of functionality at
the moment, so it's hard for me to say whether anything is hanging,
but I haven't seen anything to suggest that it is.

Jeff
