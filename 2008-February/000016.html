<PRE>Hi

 

Don't know how far you've come on the architecture of the Forms-part of
OpenViewer, but thought I'd share some thoughts. It's an obvious
approach that may or may not spark some ideas. ;)

 

In my previous job I made an advertisement application for
busses/boats/in-store advertisement.

In short, the architecture was:

Startup -&gt; Window manager -&gt; Windows -&gt; Content modules

 

Startup also started/was helped by other modules that controls content
(like downloader, content scheduler, etc).

 

Window manager started external .EXE's and communicated with them.
(OpenViewer don't need external .EXE's of course)

These window forms were positioned on different display areas (could be
different monitors or separating top &quot;ad&quot; from bottom news scroll).

Window manager also pinged the window modules to kill and restart any if
they failed. It also knew what was scheduled and how long it was to run,
for example an image for 10 sec or video for 30 sec.

 

The Windows were told (from Scheduler module via Window Manager) what to
display. It then loaded a .dll, hooked it up to one of its display
surfaces and told it what to do (for example loading
myapp.display.plugin.image.dll is told to load image1.jpg).

(It also had preloading etc, but that is not relevant here)

 

Content modules handled actual display of whatever. (Images, video,
flash, scrolling text, etc)

 

 

Using a similar approach in OpenViewer (with a Window Manager and
Content Modules) would abstract the Window (WinForms/GTK/whatever) and
the rendering engine from the application itself.

 

My app is running 24/7 on 320 busses, a few boats and I don't know how
many shops - changing content every 5-30 seconds and being monitored
remotely with screenshots daily -- so it does work at least. :)
