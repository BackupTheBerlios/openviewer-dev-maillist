<PRE>Sounds good to me.  That doesn't seem to bode well though for our
current setup though (winforms login + mogre client).  Do we scrap the
mogre rendering plugin for now to maintain crossplatformness in a
winforms only client?  In the meantime till ogredotnet is figured out,
we could do some other neat things:

-Work on integrating in more changes from SLeek into a winforms view
that we actually want.
-Think of how we want our winforms client to be designed to work with
future rendering plugins.
-What might also be cool  is use OpenViewer as a proxy between the
real SecondLife viewer and grids.  I can think of a number of cool
things that we might be able to accomplish in such a setup.

Any thoughts?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey there Johan,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You bring up some good points.  Winforms is a popular technology, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have some specific doubts:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Yes, winforms is popular, but as it stands winforms is never going
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to change.  It is replaced by wpf and it will never be improved upon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from its existing state.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - I have not seen any winforms designers for Monodevelop, so creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; winforms applications on Linux and OSX for those people would be very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult.  I worry about visual studio developers using winforms the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way Visual Studio wants, and making it incompatible for developers who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use monodevelop or commandline.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Winforms also does not have a theme which integrates well into other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operating systems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Lastly i checked on winforms support,  it was not supported in any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seriousness at all on OSX  (GUI architecture was just too different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perhaps?).  I only saw Cocoa# bindings.  I have, however, seen in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recent mono builds in which Gtk+ is flourishing though.  I just ran
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Monodevelop on OSX recently and was very impressed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Secondly, I wonder exactly how we intend to use winforms.  If we ever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get into embedding opengl into winforms, this may not be well
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understood in a crossplatform environment as much as opengl emeded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into Gtk (which is well understood because it is open source).  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worry we may use Winforms in a way that makes us incompatible with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other platforms very quickly, and not know it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lastly, I'm not entirely sure I agree with you about the only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supporting one platform until things are stable.  We may not be stable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a long time.  I would hate to leave Linux and OSX out in the cold
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; till then ( and in fact, there may be developers on these operating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; systems who we could greatly benefit from their involvement).  Without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a cross platform focus from the beginning, we risk the same problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; countless other projects failed with in that you eventually make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something that can never be ported.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also bear in mind, the answer might not be Winforms or GTK+.  An
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entirely Mogre or entirely Ogredotnet solution  ( where we let already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crossplatformed projects do our UI ) might be a good route.  There no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason why we can't be showing buttons and text inside of opengl.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I added the WinForms skeleton, after checking that WinForms seems to be

</I>&gt;<i> My reasoning was that it really isn't that bad to work with (skinning and
</I>&gt;<i> alpha blending are supported), well known, and won't require any additional
</I>&gt;<i> installation. I find it hard to believe that WinForms is going to die any
</I>&gt;<i> time soon considering the huge amount of software that has been developed
</I>&gt;<i> with it. However, WinForms is by no means perfect and the idea is that we
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to swap UI modules easily. I think we should stick with one
</I>&gt;<i> concept until the platform is a bit stable, but after that people can add
</I>&gt;<i> their own Gtk, Qt, wxWidgets or whatever module. One thing to keep in mind
</I>&gt;<i> is the licensing issue. We can use technology that is BSD-license
</I>&gt;<i> compatible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  Anyway, it is early days and if there are good reasons to go with Gtk
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not opposed to a swap. However, wouldn't this means a more complicated
</I>&gt;<i> installation process since we cannot assume that GTK will work out of the
</I>&gt;<i> box on most platforms? How good are the c#-gtk bindings? Are the XML
</I>&gt;<i> configuration tools supported, so that the UI can easily be customized?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  I guess my main argument for keeping WinForms is that it is well known
</I>&gt;<i> for c# developers, has no issues with API-bindings, and is available across
</I>&gt;<i> all major platforms without complicated installation procedures. What is the
</I>&gt;<i> main arguments for a swap to Gtk?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  How do we want to distribute openviewer to the public?  I feel this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  should be a pretty important question.  We are much more graphical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  than opensim ever is, and more people will be caring about OpenViewer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  to be easy to install and get into.  Given our crossplatform goals, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  have to consider how we can make it easy for anyone to install
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  openviewer and run it.  Several questions are in my mind:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  - Who has experience with installers?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  - What installers will we have for each platform?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  - What will the process be like? And how will we get the user to a ui
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  interface that they can use on their operating system?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  On my mind to these questions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  It would be nice to have these:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  OSX: .dmg file with a drag icon over to applications,  i'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  avoid doing a full blown out installer on OSX, but i'm not sure if its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  Linux: Packages for ubuntu and gentoo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  Windows: Nullsoft installer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  What I think we may need is the ability to have a crossplatform ui
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  chooser.  Not all ui plugins may be available for everyone. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  programmed in gtk.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
