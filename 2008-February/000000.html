<PRE>I would like do address a variety of architecture changes here i this
email.  I have been working on this reconstruction for about a week in
the hopes of making a flexible architecture for openviewer to help us
all stay sane and happy as we progress in this project =)

First some definitions I will use:
Metaverse Application Engine (MAE) - A group of assemblies that are in
responsible for running an entire type of metaverse application.  The
3D Client is a perfect example of an MAE.  3D Client is entirely in
charge of deciding which modules it will combine to put together the
user experience for the player.  Another example of  an MAE include
Console Client, which puts together all the components needed for a
console interaction with a metaverse.  Other examples may include a
Web Service MAE,  or a 2D MAE.   These are the most high level blocks
of operation in OpenViewer.

Modules -  Modules are the blocks that are put together or used by
MAE's to provide functionality to the user in some manner.  An example
of this might be a Rendering Module (opengl, directx, or mogre).  When
the 3D Client is chosen as the MAE for openviewer, a rendering module
will be chosen either by configuration or user selection.  Other
modules might include sound modules, or even more application specific
modules such as tools or logging that a user may want to add, swap
out, or remove.

Mogre - Mogre is a cross platform 3d graphics engine.  It is also
graphics technology independent.

Second:  Here are how to look at the code changes I have made

0) download the files and change the extensions from .zzip to .zip (evil gmail)
 1) Get the latest svn of openviewer
2) extract the contents of &quot;OpenViewer bin updates.zip&quot; to the bin directory
3) Delete the &quot;OpenViewer&quot; directory in the base directory
4) Extract &quot;OpenViewerSource.zip&quot; to the base directory
 5) Run prebuild ( note, I have added the runprebuild2008.bat )
6) Open the solution

Summary,
I have reorganized the architecture in 4 levels.  My primary goal has
been to make things more meaningfully seperated and organized so that
code can be more reusable, flexible, and coherent when we go to make
this massive project =)  If you are familiar with
Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, you will see where most of
my inspiration comes from.

1)  I have reorganized the startup sequence of the application.  I
still use Nini, but the startup process is much more organized and
seprated.  OpenViewer should not care where it gets its statup
configuration values from.  And I have created interfaces to the
values that openviewer will care about, and get passed to the MAEs.

2) I have understood that OpenViewer may be a not only a single type
of 3d Cleint, it may be a 2D Client, a Console Client, or even a
engine to a website.  Thus, I have created the concept of a Metaverse
Application Engine. Right now there are two MAE's in OpenViewer
directly based off the work of Chi11ken:

   Client3D  -  a 3d client to a metverse which right now only uses
mogre-based rendering modules and a little winforms (which we should
probably remove for crossplatformability)

   ConsoleClient - a simple console based client which needs some
work, but will likely be the easiest part of this project to progress
on, and get immediate results =)


3) I have begun a module architecture for Client3D.  I imagine that
Client3D will be made up of a number of modules that make the
application.  Rendering Modules, Sound Modules, Input Modules , and
maybe even other types as Tool Modules, Interface Modules, Statistics
Modules.  (Who knows).  Anyhow, I have started with the one I know for
sure, a Rendering Module, and will be attempting to build it up first.

4) Following this module system,  I am now working on the first
Rendering Module derived from Chi11ken's mogre work.  I am trying to
turn it into a solid graphics engine in the way that mogre was
intended to work.  It should be concerned only with high level
graphics concepts &quot;Draw this bitmap there&quot;, &quot;Render this 3d object
here&quot;, &quot;Move the camera this direction&quot;.




Lastly,  There are some other matters which I believe we should change.

-  Prebuild is woefully out of date.   We should use a binary only
copy from open sim.
-  There is a newer version of Mogre libraries than the one currently
in Bin.  They include a crossplatform input library ( mouse, keyboard,
joystick ).  I am going to attempt to use this in my new rendering
module, &quot;Aether&quot;.
 -  We should discuss the math library sometime, and how we would like
to unify with opensim so maybe we can use the same code
-  I would like to begin work on prim visualization as soon as
possible, there is a project called FractelSpline which I will be
looking into =)

That is all! Thanks and enjoy the code, tell me what you all think,
