<PRE>Yeah, I'd definitively suggest we create our own abstraction for the rendering surface; something that can take our high-level model and events, and turn them into render-engine and output specifics.
 
SinceI haven't even scratched at the surface on how for example Ogre differs between win and linux with regards to the rendering surface I can't really come with any concrete suggestions. I guess it's just a question of code and refactor, code and refactor. ;-)
 
Best,
/Stefan

Hi
 
Don't know how far you've come on the architecture of the Forms-part of OpenViewer, but thought I'd share some thoughts. It's an obvious approach that may or may not spark some ideas. ;)
 
In my previous job I made an advertisement application for busses/boats/in-store advertisement.
In short, the architecture was:
Startup -&gt; Window manager -&gt; Windows -&gt; Content modules
 
Startup also started/was helped by other modules that controls content (like downloader, content scheduler, etc).
 
Window manager started external .EXE's and communicated with them. (OpenViewer don't need external .EXE's of course)
These window forms were positioned on different display areas (could be different monitors or separating top &quot;ad&quot; from bottom news scroll).
Window manager also pinged the window modules to kill and restart any if they failed. It also knew what was scheduled and how long it was to run, for example an image for 10 sec or video for 30 sec.
 
The Windows were told (from Scheduler module via Window Manager) what to display. It then loaded a .dll, hooked it up to one of its display surfaces and told it what to do (for example loading myapp.display.plugin.image.dll is told to load image1.jpg).
(It also had preloading etc, but that is not relevant here)
 
Content modules handled actual display of whatever. (Images, video, flash, scrolling text, etc)
 
 
Using a similar approach in OpenViewer (with a Window Manager and Content Modules) would abstract the Window (WinForms/GTK/whatever) and the rendering engine from the application itself.
 
My app is running 24/7 on 320 busses, a few boats and I don't know how many shops - changing content every 5-30 seconds and being monitored remotely with screenshots daily -- so it does work at least. :)
