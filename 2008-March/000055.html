<PRE>Forwarding a transcript of an email conversation with Hugh Perkins
------------------------------
Interested in hearing about what you guys are doing.  By the way, I
dont know if there's much documentation about how fractalspline works.
 It's not very fractal or anything.

What it does is (if I remember rightly):
- we have a class that represents a cross-section
- you feed it points, for example a triangle has three points (gotta
love tortology :-D ), but I mean, like a prism would have a triangle
cross-section, and hence 3 points
- we then extrude that class a certain distance, with a certain
constant rotational and translational change as it extrudes.

- higher level classes, like Box, Prism (?) contain the extrusion class
- they also have a function to draw the &quot;end-caps&quot; at either end of
the extrusion

There are two types of extrusions: linear, and rotational
- rotational rotates the cross section around an axis, rather than
extruding linearly
- the translational and rotational change during extrusion still
applies for rotational extrusions
- as does cut

Textures work, cut works, rotation and translation works.  We also
have holes that are the same shape as their cross-section (eg
triangular hole in triangular cross section).

Remaining to do:
- advanced stuff that was created in SecondLife after fractalspline
came out (spirals and stuff)
- holes that are a different shape to the cross section (circular hole
in prism for example)
- may be a couple of bugs with texture rotation on the end caps (?)

Things that were most challenging:
- surprisingly the extrusion part is easy-peasy
- getting the end-caps right, and the textures on them, is quite challenging
- if I remember rightly, the main challenge with making a circular
hole in a prism is being able to draw the end-caps correctly.
