<PRE>plus 1 on the URL idea.  Though, I think the joy of having a
customizable UI allows us to not fight about it, an let the massws
decide.

I think if we can let each grid send out a UI efinition to the client
it would be ideal.  Be it html, xml, or whatever.

</I>&gt;<i> should not think of big monolithic grids. Different applications have
</I>&gt;<i> different requirements We should think of 3d websites. That is the basis of

</I>&gt;<i> tabs (meaning can be on more than one &quot;grid&quot; at same time) as well, but that
</I>&gt;<i> can come later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  But please lets not restrict openviewer to only be used on big grids that
</I>&gt;<i> you sign into and then stay on that grid for quite a while then are most

</I>&gt;<i> working. And I really hope things don't turn out that way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the url, well some &quot;grids&quot; won't need passwords etc, so it would just
</I>&gt;<i> be something like &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openviewer-dev">MW at login.newgrid.com</A>&quot; and the ones that need a password
</I>&gt;<i> can pop up a box for that to be entered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also against having a &quot;hard coded&quot; area for inventory etc. It should all
</I>&gt;<i> be modular and just generic areas in which different panels can be placed,
</I>&gt;<i> either my the user or the startup application settings or maybe the region
</I>&gt;<i> you are connected to. Not all applications/regions are going to require/want
</I>&gt;<i> inventory is the sense that it exists today, so let not make anything like
</I>&gt;<i> that hard coded.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, I think the address bar is useless.  How often do you think a
</I>&gt;<i> person is going to be manually typing in metaverse URLs?  It's only
</I>&gt;<i> going to take up space.  90% of the time a user is only going to log
</I>&gt;<i> into one or two grids manually and that might be it.  And when they
</I>&gt;<i> do, it should be automated or easy for them to log in a second time
</I>&gt;<i> without the use of an address bar.  If we wanted to do URL handling of
</I>&gt;<i> metaverse URLs ( say when someone clicks something in the REAL
</I>&gt;<i> firefox), we can, I just don't think a dedicated addressbar is useful.
</I>&gt;<i>  Connection settings are more complex than just URL, and i'm just
</I>&gt;<i> plain lazy and wouldn't want to type it out every time or deal with it
</I>&gt;<i> in string form.  I think the majority of average users would agree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I envision open viewer being more like X-Chat.  If any of you are
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with that software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a picture of the main view:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3044/2360641855_c22e80af76_o.png">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3044/2360641855_c22e80af76_o.png</A>  . The
</I>&gt;<i> chat area of the screen would be our 3D view area.  I think the area
</I>&gt;<i> on the right would make a good communications/inventory area.  And the
</I>&gt;<i> area on the left could make a good context sensitive control area like
</I>&gt;<i> Michael was mentioning ( for build tools or what not ).  Everything
</I>&gt;<i> else would be accessable via menus as Jeff suggested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take here and look how they do connections.  Basically, there is a
</I>&gt;<i> window that accessable via the menu called Network List.(
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2397/2361474720_0fa170983c_o.png">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2397/2361474720_0fa170983c_o.png</A> ) This
</I>&gt;<i> is where you manage all your networks you normally connect to, as well
</I>&gt;<i> as suggest networks that might be interesting.  I can edit a network
</I>&gt;<i> to give it more specific settings  (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2360642035_344b729ce9_o.png">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2360642035_344b729ce9_o.png</A> ).  I
</I>&gt;<i> can specify login servers, passwords, certain rooms to join, and set
</I>&gt;<i> X-Chat to automatically connect to certain networks on startup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine we can use X-Chat metaphors very directly.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - Settings Screen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It sounds like you're envisioning a separate tab in the notebook
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control for each of these functions. I was thinking more along the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lines of a Firefox for virtual worlds -- one main viewing window, an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; address bar, and windows accessible through the menu bar for things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like setting preferences, etc. (And perhaps tabbed browsing, with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support for multiple virtual world connections simultaneously)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of the major goals of this project, though, is to be highly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; customizable, so if someone wants to totally rewrite the UI, it's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fairly simple task. We just provide a default implementation (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple defaults -- a browser-like skin, a FPS-like skin, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To keep it customizable, we should limit, or at least explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; define, the dependencies between the .glade file and the code (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what widgets are expected to exist, and what types and names they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should have).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another thing to keep in mind is that at some point in the distant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; future, the UI may be partially specified by the server, so you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; log into a FPS or a virtual conference with the same viewer and get a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UI appropriate to each.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - OpenViewer Capabilities Management
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From what's on the wiki, it sounds like a lot of this should happen at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the protocol layer. Then the UI would query the protocol to see if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certain features are supported. For the time being, though, I think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's fairly safe to assume that any protocol we're using is a superset
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the Second Life protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (If anyone wants to add other totally different protocols, they're of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course welcome to do so. It would be quite interesting to see how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well the IProtocol interface can abstract the differences out.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - UserSettings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This now auto-generates an XML file when you run the app. We may want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to add a version header to it, though, to avoid upgrade problems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, my feeling is that it belongs more at the application layer than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the GTK UI.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - 3D Integration (if not, an external window will be fine)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is something we should look into very soon (though I think MW is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already). If we run into problems here (like GTK# not supporting GL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contexts, or such), it could seriously limit the usefulness of these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UI's.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - fixed some namespacing issues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If there are conflicts with the Gtk namespace, we can change to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like GtkUI or GtkPlugin or such. However, the namespace
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should mirror the file path (so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenViewer/UI/GtkPlugin/GtkMainWindow.cs should define a class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GtkMainWindow in the namespace OpenViewer.UI.GtkPlugin)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, the way we're using namespaces currently means we can't have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; classes and namespaces with the same name, so we have to avoid doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like GtkPlugin/GtkPlugin.cs.
