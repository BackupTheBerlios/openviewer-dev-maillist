<PRE>This patch is a massive reworking of the GTK UI in order to make it
inline with MVC design patterns as well as several new features:
- New UserSettings.xml file
- Storing of recent grids visited
- Storing of recent locations used
- Storing of recent usernames used
- Storage of passwords for quick reuse
- Various UI fixes
- Design prototype for console panel and chat panel

I am very happy about how GTK is going  A week ago, I was a hardcore
winforms guy, but GTK seems very capable for making high quality UI we
will need for OpenViewer.  My only problem with it is the non-thread
safe nature of GTK, which will take a little getting used to to
perform certain tasks.  But, where there is a will there is a way.
And I think applications like Mono Develop are already proof that it
can be done.

Additionally i'd like to say I'm very happy how I was able to
implement MVC pattern for GTK.  View, model, controller seperation
worked really well with GTK. The view is very stupid in code as it
should be and there is no logic in the view.  Anyhow, apply the patch,
and tell me how you like it.  Enjoy!
