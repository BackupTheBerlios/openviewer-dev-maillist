<PRE>+1 to this, I too envision a kind of firefox approach, with the address bar etc. Although I was also thinking of the main viewing window as being separated into two, the 3d portion and a 2d side bar that could have context specific things in, like when in build mode, it would have the build icons etc in it. At another time it could have a embedded web browser. also plugins could define panels that could be displayed in there when that plugin is active/selected.

I don't think we want to have separate tabs for everything, and having to swap between tabs to do something like chat.

But above all, like Jeff said, it needs to be expandable. Modules need to be able to include their own GUI panel that is integrated into the ui when they are in use.

It sounds like you're envisioning a separate tab in the notebook
control for each of these functions.  I was thinking more along the
lines of a Firefox for virtual worlds -- one main viewing window, an
address bar, and windows accessible through the menu bar for things
like setting preferences, etc.  (And perhaps tabbed browsing, with
support for multiple virtual world connections simultaneously)

One of the major goals of this project, though, is to be highly
customizable, so if someone wants to totally rewrite the UI, it's a
fairly simple task.  We just provide a default implementation (or
multiple defaults -- a browser-like skin, a FPS-like skin, etc.)

To keep it customizable, we should limit, or at least explicitly
define, the dependencies between the .glade file and the code (i.e.,
what widgets are expected to exist, and what types and names they
should have).

Another thing to keep in mind is that at some point in the distant
future, the UI may be partially specified by the server, so you can
log into a FPS or a virtual conference with the same viewer and get a
UI appropriate to each.
