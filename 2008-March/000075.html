<PRE>I really want to see a address bar, while it might not fit all needs, for some it will be good. And thats what openviewer should be about, making it flexibly so it can fit as many different needs as possible.

I don't see one or two big grids, I still see lots and lots of smaller &quot;grids&quot; (hate that term). While yes some of them will have links between them and you might be able to use the same account on more than one. We should not think of big monolithic grids. Different applications have different requirements We should think of 3d websites. That is the basis of opensim and it should be of openviewer, other wise openviewer loses its appeal for use as a viewer for custom 3d applications. So yes I want to see tabs (meaning can be on more than one &quot;grid&quot; at same time) as well, but that can come later.

 But please lets not restrict openviewer to only be used on big grids that you sign into and then stay on that grid for quite a while then are most likely going to close down the viewer. That just not how I see things working. And I really hope things don't turn out that way.

As for the url, well some &quot;grids&quot; won't need passwords etc, so it would just be something like &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openviewer-dev">MW at login.newgrid.com</A>&quot; and the ones that need a password can pop up a box for that to be entered. 


I'm also against having a &quot;hard coded&quot; area for inventory etc. It should all be modular and just generic areas in which different panels can be placed, either my the user or the startup application settings or maybe the region you are connected to. Not all applications/regions are going to require/want inventory is the sense that it exists today, so let not make anything like that hard coded.

I don't think the openviewer should look like firefox, and I don't
think it should look like all tabs.

Firstly, I think the address bar is useless.  How often do you think a
person is going to be manually typing in metaverse URLs?  It's only
going to take up space.  90% of the time a user is only going to log
into one or two grids manually and that might be it.  And when they
do, it should be automated or easy for them to log in a second time
without the use of an address bar.  If we wanted to do URL handling of
metaverse URLs ( say when someone clicks something in the REAL
firefox), we can, I just don't think a dedicated addressbar is useful.
 Connection settings are more complex than just URL, and i'm just
plain lazy and wouldn't want to type it out every time or deal with it
in string form.  I think the majority of average users would agree.

I envision open viewer being more like X-Chat.  If any of you are
familiar with that software.

Here is a picture of the main view:
<A HREF="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3044/2360641855_c22e80af76_o.png">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3044/2360641855_c22e80af76_o.png</A>  . The
chat area of the screen would be our 3D view area.  I think the area
on the right would make a good communications/inventory area.  And the
area on the left could make a good context sensitive control area like
Michael was mentioning ( for build tools or what not ).  Everything
else would be accessable via menus as Jeff suggested.

Take here and look how they do connections.  Basically, there is a
window that accessable via the menu called Network List.(
<A HREF="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2397/2361474720_0fa170983c_o.png">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2397/2361474720_0fa170983c_o.png</A> ) This
is where you manage all your networks you normally connect to, as well
as suggest networks that might be interesting.  I can edit a network
to give it more specific settings  (
<A HREF="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2360642035_344b729ce9_o.png">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2360642035_344b729ce9_o.png</A> ).  I
can specify login servers, passwords, certain rooms to join, and set
X-Chat to automatically connect to certain networks on startup.

I imagine we can use X-Chat metaphors very directly.

</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like you're envisioning a separate tab in the notebook
</I>&gt;<i> control for each of these functions. I was thinking more along the
</I>&gt;<i> lines of a Firefox for virtual worlds -- one main viewing window, an
</I>&gt;<i> address bar, and windows accessible through the menu bar for things
</I>&gt;<i> like setting preferences, etc. (And perhaps tabbed browsing, with
</I>&gt;<i> support for multiple virtual world connections simultaneously)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the major goals of this project, though, is to be highly
</I>&gt;<i> customizable, so if someone wants to totally rewrite the UI, it's a
</I>&gt;<i> fairly simple task. We just provide a default implementation (or
</I>&gt;<i> multiple defaults -- a browser-like skin, a FPS-like skin, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To keep it customizable, we should limit, or at least explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> define, the dependencies between the .glade file and the code (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> what widgets are expected to exist, and what types and names they
</I>&gt;<i> should have).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing to keep in mind is that at some point in the distant
</I>&gt;<i> future, the UI may be partially specified by the server, so you can
</I>&gt;<i> log into a FPS or a virtual conference with the same viewer and get a
</I>&gt;<i> UI appropriate to each.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - OpenViewer Capabilities Management
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From what's on the wiki, it sounds like a lot of this should happen at
</I>&gt;<i> the protocol layer. Then the UI would query the protocol to see if
</I>&gt;<i> certain features are supported. For the time being, though, I think
</I>&gt;<i> it's fairly safe to assume that any protocol we're using is a superset
</I>&gt;<i> of the Second Life protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (If anyone wants to add other totally different protocols, they're of
</I>&gt;<i> course welcome to do so. It would be quite interesting to see how
</I>&gt;<i> well the IProtocol interface can abstract the differences out.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - UserSettings
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This now auto-generates an XML file when you run the app. We may want
</I>&gt;<i> to add a version header to it, though, to avoid upgrade problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, my feeling is that it belongs more at the application layer than
</I>&gt;<i> in the GTK UI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - 3D Integration (if not, an external window will be fine)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is something we should look into very soon (though I think MW is
</I>&gt;<i> already). If we run into problems here (like GTK# not supporting GL
</I>&gt;<i> contexts, or such), it could seriously limit the usefulness of these
</I>&gt;<i> UI's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - fixed some namespacing issues
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there are conflicts with the Gtk namespace, we can change to
</I>&gt;<i> something like GtkUI or GtkPlugin or such. However, the namespace
</I>&gt;<i> should mirror the file path (so
</I>&gt;<i> OpenViewer/UI/GtkPlugin/GtkMainWindow.cs should define a class
</I>&gt;<i> GtkMainWindow in the namespace OpenViewer.UI.GtkPlugin)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the way we're using namespaces currently means we can't have
</I>&gt;<i> classes and namespaces with the same name, so we have to avoid doing
</I>&gt;<i> something like GtkPlugin/GtkPlugin.cs.
