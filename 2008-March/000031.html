<PRE>Hey all,

In an effort to keep things on OpenViewer mailing list lively.  I
wanted to write you all about my own personal project I'm exploring
and would like to build on top of the OpenViewer platform.  I'm
calling this project &quot;Aether&quot; ( <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/aether/">http://code.google.com/p/aether/</A> ) for
now.  I know many of you all are working on your own personal visions
of what the primary UI module should be, but perhaps you might be
interested in what I have in mind:

Here is my beliefs on the future of metaverses:
- Metaverses are going to be as ubiquitous as web pages one day
- The common person wants a familiar interface to work with
metaverses, and that has not been provided yet by SecondLife or any
other project thus far.
- The future must be cross platform (duh)
- We will never be able to define a UI that everyone wants to use.

With these beliefs in mind,  I plan to make Aether, a mozilla-plugin
metaverse viewer (As a UI module for openviewer).  My hope is to make
use of several technologies for UI and 3D instead of trying to create
my own.  So whats the short goal.

          &quot;Put metaverses inside firefox!&quot;

Simple enough.  What are the implications by this?

1.  We No Longer Define The UI:
Leave this up to the person who runs a website in mozilla.  Everyone
has their own styles and needs.  Why should we be imposing a
standardized UI format on people.  Metaverses ARE not games (which do
have standardized UI), metaverse are interfaces to interacting with
information.  Right now, HTML and friends are king in this area, so
lets not change that.

2.  People Might Be Connected To Multiple Grids At Once or Multiple
Locations in a Single Grid
I might be cruising through an Amazon.com grid , looking at 3D copies
of books while simultaneously  standing in a small room on a Digg.com
grid, yelling at people about the latest stories.  This has
implications for how we need to design openviewer platform.  We must
have multigrid support.  This may even have implications for opensim,
the need to be able to be logged into multiple places on a single
grid.

3. We Need To Think C++
Despite our fondness of .Net.  The real world still uses C++.  Ogre3D,
Mozilla, other technologies are our greatest allies and our greatest
limitations.  I plan to create a build system for Aether than can run
on msys on win32, and osx, and linux.   The big question will be how
much of C++ do we really need.  It is my hope that we can limit it to
just the graphics engine and just the plugin engine.  I love C#, and
want to try to write as much of Aether in C# as possible.

If any of you are interested by this idea, please check out my google
project ( <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/aether/">http://code.google.com/p/aether/</A> ) where I will be hosting
this UI module for openviewer.  I would like to strive as much as
possible to work with the core OpenViewer team to shape a foundation
that can truly be used for any UI on top of it.  Thanks, and remember
to dream big!  Please contact me if your interested in developing this
idea with me =)

- Daedius
