<PRE>I signed up for C#. I'm not interested in learning yet another language just now. But I do know that Pythoneers are very passionate about their language.

I'd suggest if the majority wants C# that you are the one that learn C# instead of everyone learning Python, regardless of how easy it is.

 

If you want to fork because you do not like what the rest have been discussing, then I suggest you do so. Threats like that do not belong in a community like this and will not be taken well.

However if you want to work with us, and make decisions with us, we truly welcome you. New members are always welcome!

I am interested in openviewer because according to some sources rexviewer is going to be merging with it. As for &quot;[p]ython is pretty far out of the capabilities of most people in this
project&quot;, perhaps you are attempting to pull my leg. Certainly if python is beyond them they are not programmers of any kind. It must be the single easiest language in the world. 

Please don't force me to fork the project less than an hour after I joined it. I exhort you ro reread my previous mail and consider whether you may be wrong.

Hi there Soren,

Thanks for your interest.  I know our mailing lists are a bit empty,
so here is what I know has been said:
* We aren't going to use mogredotnet
* Many people want ogredotnet, and some are trying to revive the
project, some like me want to create a higher level graphics engine
above ogredotnet that we can swigify for openviewer specifically.
* Python is pretty far out of the capabilities of most people in this
project.  I think many of us assume LibSecondLife (C#) is going to be
the primary thing we are building on
* Our repository is horribly broken and often.

My suggestion to you if your interested in some of the popular ideas
going around:
* Learn how to use swig
* Learn how to use GTK#
* Take a look at the Sleek project and see how it uses LibSecondLife
