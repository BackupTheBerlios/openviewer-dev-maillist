<PRE>thought I would test whether this list is actually operational, since I haven't seen any traffic.

I'm successfully fiddling away with Python-Ogre on Windows and Linux, but I think it's really important that we have 3-plat support from the get-go to the degree possible.  With that in mind, I've been watching the p-og list with an eye on Mac support.  He's a recent thread that looks promising:

<A HREF="http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2addons/viewtopic.php?t=6853">http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2addons/viewtopic.php?t=6853</A>

I should point out that I spent a good part of a week trying without success to build on either Windows or Ubuntu.  This is a *very* difficult project to get building -- it's a perfect storm of multiple libraries, multiple languages, multiple make environments, and limited attention from the devs on ease of build.  They're trying, but they have a difficult job on their hands.  I would allocate at least a *full week*, meaning hours a day for many days, if you expect to get this going -- unless you are a true build stud, in which case a coffee-injected 24-hour marathon may do it (but then no time for feedback from the lists).

I've been working with the binaries on win/unix, and concentrating on what I care about, which is getting the viewer going.  More on that soon, hopefully.
